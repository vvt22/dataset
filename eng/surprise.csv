It makes me wonder if Old Money New England families are into their own cousins a bit much.
OMG I totally forgot about that episode. What a nightmare
You president now?
Lol not gonna happen. He is just in love with [NAME]. He fell in love with her when she gave him the hand of the Queen.
I’m surprised alcohol isn’t entirely sold by the state like it is in many states in the East.
How did limewire make money?
You mean...I **don't** have to be #blessed and #thankful that I am moving to another country at the end of this month?
"Yeah, and [NAME] is not the guy he initially accused of murder. I'm not sure what the confusion is here"

Now he isn't pulling enough troops out? He just can't win..
No man don't you see!? People just change genders all the time and celebrate how fun it is! ^^^/s
"hey, everything's okay right now? "
Is anyone familiar with what the post was about? Im guessing it was on the NYC hate crime?
Oh wow. Except gillette i haven't used aby P&G products in years
a mad men fan? nice. unfortunately i dont have any idea where to get this at.
"Oh no, [NAME] baby! WHAT is you doing?"
Been sober this entire year. Still not sure what to do with my hands. Might become a cigar guy. Gotta tweak on something ya know?
What's your complaint?
"Oh, I mean I guess he’ll run if he loses. But do you think he will run if he wins? "

The amount of hate that [RELIGION] people get in the world is absolutely staggering.
What if... >Valve removes date to stop the impression they were giving an ETA

That’s! How you defeat a bear!!!!
"I try to switch it up, too; probably the main reason for the post. Gets boring sometimes!"

Some dank shit DEFINITELY happened at the Ritz back in the day.
In just 1 Year the user who posted this got a lot of karma... interesting...
oh I thought you were calling OP loser my bad
Just going to step in here to ask why you keep replying if you're unhappy with his comments?
I'm not trolling. This push for pro vaccines just seems strange.
Why did no one check [NAME] for her comments though?
It's a miracle
She missed the part where that's her problem.
"Oh man. I feel so bad for her, but am morbidly curious at the same time. Got more pics? "
"Wow that was a roasting... Deserved, but daaaaamn [NAME]"
What is the story behind your account name? Just curious.
HELL YEAH!!! And in only 7 months?? That’s such an achievement!
What country have you move to?
"So if the company announces they are recording the call, can I also record the call without telling them? Because they already know they're being recorded."
He reminded me more of [NAME] last year. His lumbering skating this year makes him look different.

This happens all the time when guys pick me up. I don’t know anything about cars. Just tell me the color
I'm more surprised the dash cam was functioning properly. Usually around these incidents 3 of them were not recording and one had the lens cap on...
There's something deeply ironic about spoil tagging this
This is exactly what happens when these fields are controlled by political ideology and not by a unbiased search of the truth.
me too! a guy a few posts up as well... I wonder how many of us we need for a class action lawsuit
With punctuation like that I'm surprised you're not from Jordanhill
I did watch it and didn’t see the thing OP mentioned. So I am not sure what I was supposed to gain from watching.
Is that his thing? (I honestly don't know what his thing is)
Yeah it's pretty odd how defensive some people are about my comment too
Ya? I don't really remember him much besides his crappy penalty shot attempt. What stuck out about him to you?
I'm honestly surprised. We should have fallen much farther
Do you want a good time or an **incredibilis** time?
The look on her face when she lies is like one I’d expect on a 6 year old who thinks he’s being cute.
I remember hearing a story about this type of highway camaraderie once from a trucker who helped a woman escape a man... wonder if it was your mom
where did they even find that photo
"Is this the place that had the creme filled donut holes, if not does anyone know where to get them"
Did that EVER work? Why did [NAME] keep going to that play over and over again when it resulted in 4th down after 4th down?
Isn't that what most of the old people forced to rot in assisted living facilities want?
"So? Sometimes it feels good to be petty, especially when it comes to an ex"
If they are going to do this why not just have individual bathrooms with locks on the doors.
I’ve made candies almonds and cashews in a slow cooker before. They’re surprisingly not mushy or soggy.
I don't really understand this video and the motivation behind it. It doesn't make sense to me.

Is that Guildford? There always seems to be plenty of zombie-like pedestrians around town!
Was that really the best option in KC? Those games looked super empty even with 20k in that stadium.
I wonder why they're single?
So glad to hear they got banned. Can't believe adults can still behave like that.
Can I just tell you how much I've enjoyed your constant dunking on this guy? Like holy crap.
"In the shower, years after it's happened and everyone else has forgotten about it."

So you wouldnt keep [NAME]?
"Doctor is Spy! ~Grunt, too late."
"But that makes even less sense. The government is having a hard time collecting taxes, therefore people are poor? "
I'm shocked. You mean to say the economic model adopted by every single financially successful country on the planet actually works? /S
Ok? Why the spammy post?
Where else was he going to hang his sash up?
Must not hit opponents on the first frame then. My mistake
What does ‘open border’ mean to you? Honest question because I may be confused by what it means
Just out of curiosity are you in the military?
How did this not get marked as meta? Tried posting something similar here and it was instantly flagged as “meta commentary about the sub” and blocked.
It's ok I still have no idea how to add
"Hey, remember when [NAME] said furries are all catfuckers? Glad he's changed since then."
Yeah knew that as well but i dont know wich color is the best to use though. Is purple the best choice?
To be fair I was in that crowd and there was barely any room to move.
Please show me where you provided any evidence to back up your claim?
"Oh look, someone who doesn't understand how living languages work."
It really didn't. You were the one who came out hurling insults around. Are you projecting? 😂😂😂
That really sucks. How old is your baby?
Part of me want to see the rest but the other part of me realises he's probably cold
BUT 3 MILLION VOTES!
I couldn’t believe my ears. she’s unbelievable.

That and i realized that i have many lucid dreams where i know that i am dreaming. I never had lucid dreams before nofap
I discovered this channel last night! She has a video on Harry Potter and the end of history that’s really good.
Had no clue what they were but first thing I realized is how bad the logo is
not sure why your rhetorical question got downvoted.
Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails?
"The real power move is to write ""Have a nice day"" even if you lose."
These are the signs I'm getting old... Wtf is a weed cartridge??
Wait so did you permanently lose sight in one eye or is this just temporary?
There's a surprising amount of [NAME] in this thread.

"Open borders, free healthcare, free college, no taxes or guns. Did I miss any of the dream? Oh yes, regulated speech too. "
I’m so glad I’m not the only one with this stuck in my head now!
Quite surprised I wasn’t on there
"Less frugal, right?"
OMG. The company logo reminded me of something. AAAAAAAAAAAH.
I don't know who is dumber here.

Are you retarded?
What were they mumbling at the end before the commercial break? That was weird.
I wasn’t even expecting the reply that’s why I’m literally bamboozled.

mtv has agreed to take some of the load by having them on...i wonder if they get paid per appearance or flat season fee.
That’s how they’ve (the cartels) been doing it for decades. Not sure how this one was done tho.
Damn you really love using name calling as a crutch don’t you?
I guess I dont see a difference between harassing someone and pretending to harass by actually harassing them. Their motivation or pre planning doesnt really change anything right?
Something Is wrong with your account then. The auctions I win get plastered all over my email and app notifications.

"Teleport, people forget you need a mask in a bank safe because of cameras, so put on a mask :D"
Wow misleading title.. Ffs
I'm glad you realize that [NAME] is part of the problem and not the solution.
Why the downvotes?
That was.. very confusing and entirely unhelpful? I read it three times and got nothing from this.
"Hahaha was this the guy, OP?"
Are you allowed to voice any political opinion on Youtube or are they also censoring based on this?
Why did I read “roommate” in the title as “comerade.” How many memes have I viewed?!

How this post is still up??🤔🤔
"Just to clarify, do you mean sidebar in game?"
I'm 35 and never knew this was a thing anyone did until I saw this posted on Facebook awhile ago. It looks massively uncomfortable?
I actually listened to the entire joke... and I read the press release from the CHRT. How about you?
Wow I typed that out before my eyes were awake 👀
Care to elaborate? I'm curious how this is true seeing as last I checked they were the highest paid in the country.
"I don’t know what that means, please explain"
No. I want to know why the law applies differently to her and how I can use that to my advantage
I still don't get what the joke was supposed to be

I’m not sure bud. But they do have multiple options. So that might be one of them
Maybe that's why it's interesting.

What are you expecting?
I had no idea. Is this recent?
Where on earth do you live that newborn non drug exposed babies up for adoption end up in the foster system? Sounds pretty optimistic on her part.

"I'm not sure anyone has asked, and feel free to not answer. But is your feeling that the team definitely favors [NAME] right now? "
Good riddance. I'm surprised it lasted that long. [NAME] is trash.

But then how will I betray it?
Makes us wonder what its going to be like for my children's generation..
I LITERALLY SAID THAT TO MY FRIEND
"Allow Ireland to become a colony of the UK, outside the EU?"
I gathered that part from the Boulder Barnes and Noble part. Was just curious if we were ever in the same ward.

[NAME] I've smoked for 20 years. Really is time to quit.

Time to cut him off. Or find a way to get him good help. Cause he sounds a little dangerous.

Is there proof this happened or is it just her accusation? I'm asking because we already know she's a liar.
Why would they lie?
Who's we? Because a lot of people on your side don't seem to want that.
Ok now I’m wondering what you’re on

Any advice on if I should keep trying to start up some text conversations or just forget about that stuff for now

You first! Make it more interesting than this!
If i remember I drank the rest of the liquor my friends and I were sharing then blacked out
