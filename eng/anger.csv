WHY THE FUCK IS BAYLESS ISOING
Dirty Southern Wankers
"[NAME] - same fucking problem, slightly better command of the English language."
Fucking coward.
Stupidly stubborn / stubbornly stupid
"Troll, bro. They know they're saying stupid shit. The motherfucker does nothing but stink up libertarian subs talking shit"
"I wouldn't let a sweet potato dictate decisions, ever."
This isn't really wholesome
The republicans are the military. You are an idiot.
seriously wtf. I want to see how the whole hand went in detail. that was the sickest soulread ever
Your team lacks ethics.
The fuck is ‚Äúmog?!‚Äù
Especially that ‚ÄúAustralia ain‚Äôt gonna cop it‚Äù ad on TV god I hate [NAME]
"Three words, no subtlety. ""Dude. Stop. Seriously."" "
"[NAME] dude I see [NAME] so rarely that I forget that he's the OG ""Fuck this character fuck this stupid game"" king. "
I KILL YOU SCUM
You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
"Stop master debating, you are making a fool out of yourself. It's concerning."
Food stamps are a disgrace. People should get money!
What the fuck is [NAME] doing in the background
It creates perverse incentives. Allow underpaid prison labour and suddenly you've an incentive towards exploiting your prison population rather than rehabilitating them.
It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.
Does nobody notice that this is a doctored photo..?? Like really bad clone stamp.. I mean it could be beautiful but this is not a real photo.
"We were all duped? I‚Äôve seen through her from day 1, even posted about how fake she is "
"I‚Äôm sorry, you just sound like one of those people who takes overwatch super seriously and has no life"
They don't seem to care much. Al qaida or ahrar al sham makes little difference anyway.
Please never don't not reproduce.
"Source each of these and trend lines from previous years please. No, listing a few agencies and telling people to Google 8t isn't a source. "
I‚Äôve seen 62 to 8 in 12 hours up north. Weather is crazy stuff.
But even then it would need something else to live
Now THAT is a murder by words!
"You tell me, was this a short trip or not? I was wrong, it was 4.3 "
He probably banked on the inherent secrecy of the community and ignorance (on Belgian law) of his victims.
Damn thats so cheap
[NAME] already had that in their comment and I didn't deny it. I guess that level of attention to detail isn't taught at Bellevue Community College.
She's ugly so that might add some more months.
"Another reason to instantly kill people who constantly use the word ""awesome"" for everything. This is just brainless mediocrity at its best."
Stop arguing with people.
Only married once so can't be that bad. Not that it even matters
I HATE that song...I did not vote for it. A few of my songs I liked went at around 60-70
He can't rescind. What a dumbass
Don't know why anyone would need more explanation than this video
[NAME] fucking [NAME] please no
I would say. ‚Äôgood‚Äô but it‚Äôs all fucking tragic.
[NAME] and [NAME] should be there too E: Damn didn't think this would be unpopular lol
Ask him if he wants to a warm glass of shut the hell up.
No steel toe boots either. Amateurs. If the owner made his cooks do this instead of proper contractors he deserves a workers comp claim.
That guy is being intentionally obtuse. Down vote trolls are a waste of everyone's time.
You‚Äôre not being used but she has no right to tell you what to do with your money.
A machine would literally do a worse job than him.
Thank you I hate it
B plug? What the hell. Use an A plug or you're never going to become doctor some day.
[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.
Damn hippies.
Growing up there were people in our church who hated the Smurfs because they were magic using communists.
We aren't a bunch of Republican puppets like you believe.
Its ok we all know you suck scrub.
"I get ghosted all the time after I open pics. I don't like it, so would not do it to someone else."
"I dont know, she seems pretty gangster to me."
You shouldn't force someone to come out you know. Now look at what you did! You killed [NAME]! You bastard!
"Yeah dude, that's illegal in so many ways."
"Oh I remember that final , I just dont want to involve my team in the conversation because we share a rivalry"
Ya i hate to talk bad about don‚Äôt but they should get the sticks out of their butts and make smarter decisions for their community
"Comments like these are the biggest reason I get so pissed off about fucking centrists crying about the ""both sides"" argument. "
fuck atheist countries
Is your job my job? Because I don't know what it is about hardware stores that make Ppl stupid but hell are they stupid...
Look we are starving but we still have some honor. We don't need any help from your people. Especially not 50 cents a day
This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
"Ding Ding Ding, exactly where I called BS"
Poeling is looking like a fkn stud. Imagine our C depth next season... [NAME]... holy fuck
Didn't find it believable even from the start
Its to bad he doesn‚Äôt give Tomlin this treatment.
"Again nothing, you are the one obsessing over that term, he literally says he puts girls on a pedestal. "
Because majority of moves have stupidly long names. GO INTO ANGEL PUNISHER INTO DIVE BOMB RADIANCE AND FINISH THE JOB WITH PUNISHING LIGHT BLADE
What? Who said I hated him? I dont give a damn about him either way.
"Nobody got time for that, Dont even like twitter"
"""I'm not the one constantly talking about getting laid, YOU are!"" "
I didn't mean for that to sound racist I just mean those [NAME] in the article
"[NAME] was my favorite. And I liked [NAME] her first season. They both suck now, so damn hard."
I'm fucking starving here.
I have the same issue with a new co-worker and it drives me insane.
Eat my fuck- [NAME]
The secret and walk away endings are not cannon.
Plus corporations are universally unethical
"I wouldn‚Äôt worry, most United fans have never even been to Manchester. "
Looks deliriously boring.
"You came at me with attacks, so no, you get NOTHING!"
Of all the injustices in the world!
If you think he's working 2400 times harder than an average minimum wage worker then there's something severely wrong with your world view.
This is almost worse than Santa Con. Can we get millenials to destroy this please.
FIRE THE MEDICAL TEAM.
"Ugh, he sounds like a slob and you should leave him."
"Damn I got a notif from a (very cute) friend saying ""no u"" on Discord right before I saw this"
"4 lives essentially, its insane"
"Ooohhh shit, they did *not* just say men should be decent human beings, they've finally taken it too far! Gather the troops! /s"
Fruit is byfar the worst of all flavors
Disagree wholeheartedly. I'm actually amazed anyone can think this way.
Your just killing time now.
Fucking and being a boy
food pranks really irk me üòî
You shouldn't be using hydrocortisone on your face:
"Fuck the White House, fuck McDonald‚Äôs and fuck this post."
2016 was also the worst year of my life
Bitch yes!
"I'm not telling them, I was just saying that the person who knew them irl said they were a she. That is all"
Unless the government steps in and does something stupid
No I thought that movie was really bad. I could relate to requiem for a dream.
That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
There's a difference between rights and law. Stop conflating the two.
What the hell
Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.
I don't really want to do anything.
What the hell are you talking about?
That's true for every loss except for this one. He's being really petty and hasn't taken the [NAME] loss well.
I get it. I hate that [NAME]. Taking advantage of sad people.
The likes of [NAME] utter genius cannot be fathomed by mere mortals
"By ranting aimlessly on the internet about it, obviously ;)"
"No, that means you're actually 41."
Box up all his stuff and put it outside the door
Why the fuck do people have these conversations in public
that's why im here in the overwatch university subreddit you fucking idiot.
Older nurses seem to have less tolerance for the bullshit of hospital work and move on once it gets to be too ridiculous.
They've all fucked your mother. Just ask them.
"An ex-friend of mine proclaimed than anyone who speaks of being raped is a horrible, unethical human being."
too much logic in there for remainiacs only interested in cheering for unicorns and insulting the british people.
Ive seen that move no less than 5 times and I still get irrationally angry at the Harvard rich kid
You don't follow [NAME]. You're a hypocrite following man's interpretation of the word of [NAME]. Youre too stupid to even be embarrassed.
It really sucks that almost everything we know and love about [NAME] is either told to us by proxy through other characters or is the result of fan-fics/shipping.
"Burnout takedown. Then when trying to recover in the weekend, a nice chunk of self condemnation."
[NAME]!
"No, I don't mind all that much. I just hate being subjected to second hand carcinogens"
Nah man. This website smells like toast and makes my left arm hurt.
Human trafficking is bad.
You quack!
i hate this
Yeah it sort of sucks now.
I dont own a gun. I just dont like your attitude. You read like a drugged out washed up leach.
"Sorry dumbass, the provision is for paid **training days** But nice try"
Nobody would flop like that in practice
AV is a system where if you vote for a loser you can change your mind and 'have another go'. That's the problem.
That was never in discussion all Miami wanted was to get rid off the whole contract.
Whaaaaaaat the heck was that?
Let them argue. We've never done anything remotely as bad as MOST OF THE WORLD does routinely.
Ok so this doesn't seem like a cover given they made a whole comp for him
"> If everyone is put on the same level, where‚Äôs the competition? That's not what communism is.."
" I don‚Äôt give a F F the haters F all the haters Much love, no hate Machines within, machines within"
They didn't play it safe. They played it big and failed hard. The plot is too damn big for a soft-reboot game.-* +
He‚Äôs so eager to please! This trait in dogs is so endearing.
You forgot blue passports
"You are the type of fellow that puts mommy in the cheap home and cashes her cheques, loyalty of a snake."
He'd hate me. My standards are even higher.
‚ÄòMy Goddess went to prison and all I got was this crappy t-shirt‚Äô
Hey.... that's not the wallet inspector...
I hate that I like them...
That's an extremely ignorant thing to say
[NAME] wasn't accused of sexual assault
"This qualifies as emotional neglect. Just, to be clear, that is a form of covert abuse and is not okay or normal."
"At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
Uhhhhhhhhh well that's not good
[NAME] I hate this
"Fuck right off, it was illegal at the time so the law was being broken. Learn to live with your actions and their consequences you whiny socialists."
"Holy fuck, report this now. The fuck you doing on reddit? "
"the original concern was about one particular type of vaccine, not all vaccinations."
Go fuck yourself.
Damn you and your facts.
1 Corinthians 13 üòÖ I am lazy so i won't write it down sry
Not my proudest fap
Your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter enough to me to trigger me :)
Fuck that guy for game 2
The number of pedos is too damn high!
"I mean... It's about average. So not $200 but not ""throw it in the trash"" either. "
And most ironic. We created the language but people still don‚Äôt properly understand us as the mutated the damn thing
That‚Äôs a fuckin budgie. You gotta be a moron at birds to not know that. That‚Äôs like Bird Basics 101.
This is a very cursed lineup
"& when you call them on their shit they ban you from their subreddit for ""oppressing people"""
It feels weird to me cause im the type of person who always immediately texts back
"Ignore him, he is a spiteful little rat who is mad because someone did something good and it reminds him how pathetic he is."
No one gives a fuck about your internet points guy
He‚Äôs been shit. Makes the wrong decision in the final third every time this game.
Am I wrong? So many people from NY say it's really gone downhill. Doesn't mean I don't like public transportation
Damn you! Now all this dirty money is flooding Frankfurt and Dublin!
Any differing opinion that exists is heresy.
Peaky Blinders is the shit. I don't understand how there isn't more hype around this show.
"Ah, modern society's obsession with romance for the sake of romance‚Ä¶ I hate it."
How is one not amused by that? I can't imagine being angry even if it was my lunch. lmao...
>Rise of Agon Literally the worst fucking game that man kind has ever managed to accomplish and you call him a carebear? Fuck out of here.
"Yeah, that teacher was a disaster. She got fired a year later for just being an all around idiot."
"Idk I feel like it's just an exaggeration, English is a hyperbolic language"
"I wonder why the fuck out of this alive. well, there was a perfectly reasonable explanation."
"Also his Whirlpool seems to be bugged, sometime it stays for like 3more seconds even tho you don't get any damage from it anymore"
"Man'. The point became invalid once the school yard name calling came out. And, 'this year'. It's only January."
"I mean, he is a terrible president. "
Don't call me bitch you fucking sexist. I bet you are one of those white devils. How many women and minorities have you suppressed today?
Well to be fair to these idiots Family Guy constantly makes episodes complaining about their lack of Emmys.
Trying to read that made me feel like I just huffed formaldehyde amd mercury
No.. This dudes a little wack in the head
Like an idiot.
Honestly never seen one as dumb as this.
Stupid democrats!!!!!!!
Except you didn't and it's still false.
And yet still just outside of the playoffs and not the worst team in the last 10 games.
As it should be. No way I'd want my kid crossing 5 lanes of traffic to get to the bus everyday.
OH MY GOD!!!! The poor parents must have gone from gutted to PISSED in a matter of moments.
I want my fucking cake back.
They were talking about what they should call the 'not Constantinople' release in the meeting- its a crime that nobody thought of this.
Don't tease me with [NAME].
"[NAME], [get_user_id] is a moron."
We have tradable assets next year and cap space the year after. We don‚Äôt need to implode to retool.
"I was quoting him. He wanted an ""outsider rich business type"", piss off"
Fuck that its not my money they're giving him. I want a goalie with a .970 sv% dangnabbit.
What's the fucking point of this post? Is just baseless claims with no proof to back them up.
Wouldn‚Äôt have looked as cool.
"No, we should increase border security because we have an absurd number of people crossing illegally."
"They played loud music on a ‚Äòschool night‚Äô, seriously! You‚Äôre backing the bastards here just to be contrary."
"Please stop LOOKING, and go."
I dont believe shit until america confirms the transfer.
Because our roster has gotten worse each year since 2017 and the team is spending less. That isn't a recipe for continued success
Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start
your character's so broken!
Women wear makeup to threaten other women. It has nothing to do with men. Same w all their weird mutilations.
Beak makes no sense. Well beaks make no sense anyway but this one especially
I came here to laugh at memes. Not feel feels
"Not practicing with the team, seems like a bad sign for playing today. "
R/T DIDN'T WANT IT!!!!
Curb your enthusiasm theme.
NL West had 3 teams in the playoffs in 2017 and 2 in 2018......wtf you on about
They killed me [NAME]. They killed me with schlock
"> In some, cops fire blanks in the hall to simulate an active shooter scenario. That's incredibly stupid, and serves no purpose."
I meant mainsource [NAME]. the one that assists you on your journey. >! not the one that is evil as fuck!<
This is blatant racism and harassment of minors. These people need to be fired.
"Didn't realize they were shipping the challenge coins with Israeli FAL rifles, that makes this whole thing even weirder."
> make sure you register the claim against them and hit their credit score how does one do this?
"Absolutely not! If religions didn‚Äôt exist on this planet, we would be a far more advanced society."
Anyone who downvoted this comment doesn‚Äôt understand the necessity of government.
Just don't bring up the Manga Carta. Really uncomfortable for my history class.
I would prefer to not observe it all but federal law does not allow it.
Yeah tis marketing tweet from the melbourne AFLW team about their captain seems like marketing being pushed down my throat. You woke af.
"Don‚Äôt do this. Unless you‚Äôre a total prick. Communicate like an adult, don‚Äôt play games like a child."
"No, I generally feel like slugging them in the head repeatedly with an iron bar. Spitting is just petty. *Let your hatred flow!*"
We created these beasts unfortunately. I don't feel right blaming the [NAME] for this one.
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU‚ÄôRE TALKIN‚Äô TO ME!
Idk if you ask most store managers they will say they started as a cart pusher Probably bullshit but still.....
BUT ATHEISTS ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND ARE TREATED BETTER. No. You're just being a bigot.
Get the fuck out
Also [NAME] raised money because so many of his subscribers are dumb enough to confuse an Indian company with the country of India.
"I just don‚Äôt like traversing through the snow, and how the salt stains some of my boots, and the mess it leaves at home."
genji dmg buffs are eh but everything else except a nerf to zen are crazy
Who fucking cares. People have sex all the time. You're just an asshole for trying to to profit from it or ruin her.
You shut your stupid mouth troll. Thy absolutely matter
Fucking Real Madrid
"[NAME] didn‚Äôt just fight dogs, he, personally, tortured them too. He isn‚Äôt a dog fighter, he is a sociopath."
"Hell yea brother, Charlotsvile car attacker did nothing wrong Lets see how quick they scream hate speech"
"Serious question, where was this? That looks like my ex in the green top."
DON'T DO THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES LIKE THAT THEY DON'T WANT HER EITHER BRUH
This post is a waste of time and doesn't belong here.
"Not the snowbank, though. That will end badly in spring."
I don‚Äôt want my tax dollars going to some psycho who thinks he‚Äôs a girl trapped in a mans body
Fuuuuck that's rough
Poor poor poor bastard
Which is weird because I can still get hours every week the day before if I wanted to.
"Am I out of touch? No, it's the [NAME] who are wrong!"
- But mom! I don‚Äôt wanna go to school today! - You‚Äôre going little shit.
"Ugh, this fucking tumblr account. I posted about this bitch before, they wrote that [NAME] drug rehab fanfiction."
"Nope, no deal far more likely to starve the country than U-boat blockade."
Don't tell me what to do. I'm not going to argue with someone who goes around calling everything bro science.
Well obviously not. Some people have higher tolerances than others. That‚Äôs a fact. I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you.
"1.) Its not real socialism 2.) All government is socialism pick one ""socialists"" fire departments arent socialist "
"They're just misguided, useful idiots."
Greasy bastards are getting part of what they deserve. Some fines just don‚Äôt seem to be enough sometimes
The visual change is an underrated buff. The few times you could juke a legion as survivor were likely due to his blur that just got lessened.
Eat the damn rich already!
Dream market is also down for me in the USA
[NAME] had some pretty harsh words.
I MEAN HE'S NOT WRONG
I wasn't ready for the wholesomeness when I saw it.
"They're wrong, it was due to their natural wetland habitats being degraded & drying out. "
They can't they need a morty dumbness shield
Another episode of idiots with guns
"No, it was believed that the baby absorbed maternal traits because the mother was the ""soil"" the ""seed"" grew in. "
"She took the fucking kids, huh?"
I really don't like the way she says zombie. It sounds like she tryed to fill up space.
"Who the fuck reads news *papers* anymore? Baby boomers. This kind of crap is totally written by a ""journalist"" in need of a safe place."
"First of all, that's not true in any sense of the terms. Second of all, I'm not a national socialist lmao"
You can't compare general economic losses to tax funded expenditures. It would only be fair if we lost 5 billion in tax revenue.
Damn that sucks did you get a tip at least?
"What should be the campaign is telling people that just because you find a child beautiful/pretty, it doesn't mean you're sexually attracted. "
The fucking worst game in the world.
[NAME] a fucking creeper. Doesn't he have some weird ass relationship with that 14 year old girl from Stranger Things?
Well that sucks. The disconnect reconnect and keeping your bloodpoints I mean. The accidental vs purposeful disconnect seems fair.
People keep giving serious arguments but you keep replying ‚Äúbut mah happiness‚Äù Not worth it to lose time arguing with the likes of you
Now you‚Äôre reddit staking me? Don‚Äôt comment on my stuff dude.. gtfoh
Bro he has always been a bully in the community. He is a pseudo scientist.

im here for blood only whether it comes via hostage situation or police chase. a peaceful ending doesnt do it for me anymore
Everyone makes the NREMT test sound like the devil. It really isn't that bad.
"Tell her to stop being so fat, then. Edit: /s"
[NAME] damn it
FUCKING DIN!!!
This genuinely made me angry. He and his sociopath of a wife deserve each other.
"We all saw it, my American friend. Now go and fix your government."
Fucking fuck! 2 (or more) sets of fucking socks in fucking sandals.
annoyed at most
That they wield to great effect to tell *you* why you‚Äôre crazy and how it‚Äôs totally not their fault
shut your deregulating lying mouth bill
I hate when people down vote to hell when someone has a different (yet valid) opinion
There is irony in what you guys are saying.
The titles of her posts are somewhat dramatic and I have avoided her because of that
You're a tenant if you lived there for months and that was an unlawful eviction.
"Who cares, most people will be on their phone anyways."
That's not fickle. That's insane and delusional. It's not some cute little quirk. It's a disconnect with reality.
This is infuriating but what‚Äôs also infuriating is missing all of our chances and players being constantly in offsides positions
I just have never found that area very attractive. Also from what I understand there is a lot of contaminated burial sites around there.
"That, plus they also store our info insecurely so it leaks out. Just another part of this dumb economics game I guess..."
I hate to say this but I love the drama around this all.... idk. My life is boring
"""If you don't support no go zones, you are racist!"""

"I can hear [NAME] now: ""Why don't I have a mic why don't I have a mic FUCK I need a mic"""
Yeah Stupid Sexy groening
Bishop [NAME] was talking about lawmakers rather than the women who seek abortions. Though the situation doesn't matter when it comes to dismembering a baby.
[NAME] is actually a terrible player
[NAME] damn it I'm so tired of seeing Instagram between fights
"No you don't, you love lies and liars. "
Nothing more Jersey than the sound of car horns over [NAME] rambling out an annoyed answer to a caller.
Old Firm game also on the same day. Media won't care about the rugby.
"was i replying to you, you fucking degenerate? off yourself ( in game ofc )"
Watch the ignorance of a variety of topics manifest itself as word diarrhea just falling out of her dumb mouth.
What I know is you seem perfectly comfortable being a hypocrite but utterly outraged at the idea of admitting to it.
Dont keep your mouth shut.
"Such a sad, angry person. Take a break from reddit and go take up cycling or something."
I'm keeping my mouth shut. I don't want you yokels crowding up the wine store I go to.
Terrible... children are innocent and precious. This is so barbaric.

"From what I remember, a lot of the leafs fans had [NAME] from 8.5-9.25. I can‚Äôt recall someone saying 10+"
When there is 1 in 20 posts that is remotely serious and it gets 20 upvotes Vs 1200 of those that memes get...
"Weird thing, but my cat will go HAM on my earhole if I let her."
Ehhh but as a survivor I hate noed and hex ruin why would I run them against someone else
Any man who won‚Äôt fight for his kids isn‚Äôt worth your time.
What an idiot.
And a pretty bad [NAME] too.
the fuck? I would do it in a heart beat. ya'll nuts if you think [NAME] will draft any better than [NAME]
"Stop, your hurting me!"
Seriously! I'm on Xbox and all my crew and we have never had an issue!
But it literally had. Her name on it. Kids are so fucking stupid.
Good luck going to jail.
Hate them. I really don't need to hear about you pissing your pants in the first grade.
"I almost downvoted you, because ‚ÄúBoooooooo!‚Äù"
Never let a fact get in the way of a bad argument apparently.
i would not want to be they guy operating the reloader while 2000RPM of 30mm shells are firing
Wrong. You tried to use a WW2 example and it backfired on you.
GIVE ME OTHER PEOPLES MONEY!!!!!
This is alternative facts level populism. The man is a liar.
Those other countries clearly exploited to shit? Dats cuz it's not mah [NAME]. -You with your big brain logic.
Don‚Äôt ever play poker! Lol
You know better. People will just ignore this and move on to their next talking point.
"That‚Äôs gonna be a no from me, [NAME]!"
I don‚Äôt fucking care

And [NAME] should go sell his wife's ketchup. He's good for nothing else besides selling out our country.
My t levels are normal. Doctor thinks its my low carb diet but I dont buy that
Ur a dumbass
"B, I dont frink coffee anyways "
Reason number 1523648856 PFF is trash no one should take seriously
But everybody got mad when Russia recognized [NAME] as US president. Go figure.
How dare u/Reijka92 disrespect [NAME] like that!
"My bf uses profanity, and I don't care. There's no reason for misogyny though."
We're going to return to [NAME] and [NAME] being bffs again and talking shit about [NAME] or some other random shit.
"I wouldn't volunteer a second honestly. That weather is not worth it, and neither are your coworkers."
That's false

"Middle guy doesn't look to fit to me. Looks like me, too many pounds."
"Honestly, Queen kinda sucks. Obvious they were ripping off My Chemical Romance."
No. We wouldn‚Äôt have enough room to play them all and each of them would add like 10-15 mill in luxury tax. EACH.
I would be more offended to be served cereal on a plate.
Going from [NAME] to [NAME] on the PP is like going from tenderloin to convenience store hotdogs

Wow you just disregarded his entire comment.
"Yet, here we are, a whole sub full of people who seem interested in the stupid things incels say and do... ü§î /s"
Reddit hates women.
That‚Äôs another unfair accusation. I spent a lot of time trying to reach an understanding with you.
Her Twitter checks also clearly a fucking idiot.
I don't think this makes much sense for Sacramento.
What the fuckkkkk burn itt
"I considered becoming a teacher, but then I considered the little bastards would eat me alive."
Then the argument is entirely wrong. Democratic socialist are not communists. Conservatives aren't fascists.
Fortnite is not a good game anymore smh my head

How the hell do you get downvoted for a submission statement on /r/TrueReddit. Title or not it is still required.
DAMN!!!

RNG gear is a solid no from me.
The capitalist countries have welfare for those that can cope. The other countries dont.

Fuck yea!

Good [NAME] she needs to stop
Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
Dumpster fire. I cant quit you Edmonton!!
Those are female toes. Busted!

That's not an actual thing you realise? No one is that stupid.
So what? The LW doesn't. want. more. children.
This sum GTA 5 type shit right here.

I don't like [NAME] but I'd never wish this fate to any parent.
I'd also report to the post office... and next time these nasty neighbors come-give them the number to call and complain.
"Yeah, it does that to me on my laptop. Nothing just happens. If I try on mobile I just get that error message."
Delete this. Not relevant.
Kinda both. The show itself is mediocre and has pretty generic jokes in my opinion. But the fans make me dislike it even more.
"Yup, already blocked his number, he was never supportive "
But also: fuck the daily mail
The least offensive example of anyone I've seen telling me to go fuck myself.
No they haven‚Äôt and that‚Äôs probably a lot of the problem
Argument a month. I should be so lucky.
It's irrelevant though. it doesn't need to be specified in the title of a post.
I see a 14 day old reddit account angry at liberals.
Holy shit I‚Äôm stupid
I'm only saying it because I'm jealous :(
There is nothing that back ups his claims. To me his views sounds more like wishful thinking.
It won't be. Just a rumor.
"I will have nothing to do with this specter, who selectively appears to individuals and abandons others. No better than a cruel warlord."

And even then... It won't be for long.
That sentence should be illegal.
I want to clarify that I am NOT scared. I punched the mirror because it looked at me wrong.
That dude popped a viagra and got stuck in his neck.
it really sucks how absolutely fucked some of us got genetically in the chest department
[NAME] isn‚Äôt even a homer at this point. He‚Äôs just dumb.
Definitely not a dead human body. He‚Äôs probably just a weird dude that has some weird thing in his room that smells terrible.
Nothing like a little bit of whataboutism. We can think they're *both* idiots.
I couldn‚Äôt live like this. You should leave.

I doubt that [NAME] cares.
That doesn‚Äôt help people in market though.

I blame [NAME].
Unable. It's not really possible. It's not his only interest but it's the one I can't really do anything about.

You need to look in the mirror if you going to say that [NAME] is overrated yet want to trade him for scrubs like Dedmon
Close your damn mouth before it catches a fly
It is hard to make up the new relevant points at times.... Revolution they say
"Yeah fuck this shit, the dude isn't even doing anything noteworthy, it's just a man doing his job."
Weird flex but ok
I asked her before I told her. She took it on herself. I say NO all the time when I don't want to hear sadness and pain
I'm just here to say fuck [NAME]
"Yeah man, fuck the man. Can‚Äôt have people getting free stuff or have any creative marketing ideas."
Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse

**YOU CANNOT MURDER ME! IT'S ILLEGAL.**
He's not had a great season but Athletic in general has been a shitshow this season (and last) so no real surprise there.

No way a tattooed ex-con with a drug/drinking problem might turn abusive!

awful vehicle physics that cause you to instantly die when hitting small bumps and certain angles! WHY!
Gotta offload this crap somehow.

I'd rather not be in the 90's kid category anyways.
Don't think you should be nominated for Breakout and Best of the year but whatever.
You spend most of your time here in the Rangers threads talking about how much you hate the huns. That's pretty weird as well.

I heard the same thing after she had made false allegations and tried to hoover me back . Its so triggering now .
"Was my friends family... They had the wrong address, you're sick dude. "
"Don't just distance yourself, BLOCK them"
"Yup, it may not look like much but it‚Äôs still statistically significant. That‚Äôs really bad for something being decided by a coin toss."
I think its justified because that dude freaks me out. The less money the better.
I hate beer. But I'll concede the point because others like it. ;)
"I didn't like this, not for even one second. "
What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.

Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
You don't get to decide what is discussed in this thread. You are not in charge here.
It could also be that coupledom is the wrong way to live for OP.
"That‚Äôs what I thought. With 4 out of the 9 still on the show, I just can‚Äôt call it accurate at all."
if it's harassment its a criminal charge. I haven't read the decision yet but this seems like a stretch based on what i know.
Just horrible. Doesnt solve any of his problem and removes his strongest tool.
That‚Äôs not a fucking card?!

Seeing the Reverend talk to his son like that always made me feel uncomfortable but also mad.

"Fuck you, that's how"
Print outs?!?!?! You tree killing monster!!!!
#Garbage site for assholes
My mom and I do the same exact thing. I hate it.
Because sloppy seconds is a childish concept and I dont see bargain basement girls.
The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
> Killing an intruder in your home in self defense is now a really bad thing. That was not even under discussion.
We won't. If Ireland do they'll be violating the GFA.
"I review you - *clap clap* - [NAME], bye bitch, gone"
Sounds like he dodged a bullet. You‚Äôre kinda dumb.
Yet again; totally missing my point.
"Just legalize it, already. Do it the proper way instead of by executive fiat. I hate the lawlessness‚Äî‚Äúthe pen and a phone‚Äù bullshit."
Inland Empire must be objectively the worst film ever then.
"What is up with the second, slightly differently orange hairline in front of the other from hairline? What the hell is going on there?"
You're making yourself look more stupid with every reply. Google what the heck model organisms are.
You laugh at them. Openly. For being childish and naive. If they don‚Äôt react to facts maybe they‚Äôll react to wounded pride.
your joke sucks
Everything on the internet is real and serious... Im here to be downvoted and laugh.
I don't like the zombey cookies.
"No problem here, as long as neither one of you are the asshole."
does any body notice that 8 in 2018 looks weird
No it's laziness. People don't clean because there isn't an immediate consequence and the reward for cleaning isn't large enough.
tbh college has been a hair easier for me than high school. The worst of it is making tuition and trying to register for classes
These honestly are getting infuriating. The creator of this made this whole thing up yet Facebook old people take it as reality.
My mother did this. This isn't just a millennial thing.
It's irrelevant because that's not how we elect presidents. He won an electoral landslide. He flipped several democrat strongholds. He did just fine.
It's bad when that sounds tasty to me
If we backed a second referendum and the Lib Dems were at 10% I'd be pretty annoyed to be honest. Cheeky sods.
Mug that fool

NO BOY! NO MORE FREEDOMS TO GO AROUND HERE! Now go back to your room and give me your toy guns immediately
"Reading comprehensions not your strong suit I‚Äôm guessing, no I don‚Äôt personally believe that, just pointing out an anecdote."
Is the wooosh on us cause there‚Äôs no fuckin wooosh to begin with or
Why everyone mad i think it was a joke .people these days over sensitive my [NAME].
Then I disagree that being a cog in someone‚Äôs machine is reason to be resentful.
"i mean, never listened to zepellin much, not even acdc, i didnt know acdc suck"
Stop saying generic hating sentences!
"I cannot be more clear myself: If you do not have a comparable situation, you do not have a valid point to be making"
"I don‚Äôt want everybody to live the same way as me, I just wanted to express the stupidity of it."
The Cavs didn‚Äôt even want [NAME]. They just wanted to fuck with us.
" cute, new driver still cares. Come back in 4 months and u will be showing pictures of that bag thrown on the trunk. "
We can‚Äôt stand for this any longer!
Just get pissed next time he asks and tell him to fuck off Some people just think they can take advantage of people who help them
The first article on their is talking about the [NAME] documentary...? E - there*. What the hell is my phone doing
And then the rest of that thread devolves into [NAME] supporters arguing against and downvoting anyone who disagrees with the wall or hates [NAME].
The dense stuff isn't very accessible. :/
"You arent going to be making 10 million dollars in your business, this wont affect you."
They want to make gun ownership so expensive and onerous that people won't even bother.
What a complete and utter cunt.
Intolerance of intolerance isn't intolerant my dude
They do not need to. A majority of the vox populi think like you do.
"Do as I say, Not as I do"
"Noooo... Went and saved all the webpages as PDFs, though it's not a perfect solution."
USE GLOVES YOU MANIAC
Its like the worlds most infuriating reality show.
[NAME] was just calling you out for being rude as fuck
A track would be much more suitable for this kind of recklessness! Keep this kind of dangerous driving off of public roads!
You didn't come here to debate. You came here to excuse abhorrent behavior.
">Downvote me, you cowards."
">The Charisma Myth"" It's bullshit too."
"Getting upset and triggered over a hat is absolutely failed moral character, and a sign of deep immaturity. "
[NAME] dirty talk really just Doesnt Work for me. Sounds silly at the best of times.
I must break you!
I'm also a human being but I can't think of any reason why I would physically hurt a woman.
Please explain how this is stupid
Not liking [NAME] is not statism. Removed.
Nah see that's the kind of pessimism that makes you more depressed. Even if they're not genuine you can still take it to heart.
"This isn't a sport from Holland it's from Frisia, the title is wrong"
Because they don‚Äôt want to pay for [NAME]
Shameless IG plug:
Damn I never had to wait that long. Then again where I live is a town more than a city so much less busy etc
That's beyond fucking creepy!
No surprise there. It was always his policy to table it upon the deal's failure in Parliament as was set out at the Labour conference.

Worst CB we‚Äôve had in recent memory
Ok. Hang onto shit you can't change and be whiney about it. This is a reason why we catch shit. We can't take it
No. Just no.
Seems like every season she is less hot. Too bad
I think [NAME] is honestly just a whack job.
"She wasn't fucking running, no matter how hard you insist. You'd make a wonderful Qld cop with that mentality."
"Given the horses ass you lot made of the last one, I think it‚Äôs best to put this idea on the back burner."
I don't think that makes for a fair deal. That $100 is far more valuable. It's more of a disposable income thing for me.
Crocodile tears.. üôÑüêä
But then they can't draw the m word
And please do not dab unless you are at bingo.
Thats harassment brotha. Do you double dare me
"Oh boy.. ""The Beginner's Guide"" game on steam had me messed up for a couple days.."
This hurts my brain
This is what happens when untrained people playing at being detectives and judges run into actual detectives and judges.
Almost downvoted you just because that made me so angry.
"Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]..."
Let‚Äôs get greedy and take back what is rightfully ours
US labor laws are fucked up
I‚Äôm downvoting because it seems like r/iamverysmart material.
Dressing room back bone is not somebody who always blames others for his mistakes on the pitch.
She's so remarkably stupid.
Ikr. Who the hell goes to Greggs for *pizza*?
Go look up China‚Äôs virtual news anchor.
This is why I could never work in construction
Honestly if you had to live in punchbowl you‚Äôd be angry too
Seriously. OP needs to get their shit together.
Argh. The most stupid and needless abuse of power teachers do. Some particularly stupid ones at least.
Well that‚Äôs dumb. The question is about this sub.
"If it was low-fat mayonnaise, their response may have been justified. That stuff is horrendous."
"You don‚Äôt understand it because it‚Äôs insanely dumb, as the vid demonstrates."
Lakers truly have the worst fans
No. I'm just against forcing your beliefs on people who aren't old enough to distinguish reality from fiction.
There is a special place in hell for drivers like you. I pray to [NAME] there is.
Anyone else want a TE early? Tired of fucking around with the position even if [NAME] did look pretty mean for a few weeks
It seems you've never played HotS.
Huh? edit: /u/DanVsStu I have no idea what this show even is - you have the wrong account
Plus there's this expectation/trope of flowers sent to workplace being a way for someone who's fucked up to apologize (which is icky as hell but whatever)
False equivalence in the sense property rights aren't enforced but more accurately defended.
What a loon
"Utah is terrible, I hated driving through there at night"
Bruh you don‚Äôt belong here
"Some college professors and their teaching staff may need to die. Oh, wait... saying that is hate speech."
That's not what diffusion is at all smh
[NAME] looks miserable in those photos.
Subpoena is still one of the weirdest words I‚Äôve ever seen
"""I don't socialize because i'm unhappy and i'm unhappy because I don't socialize"". -Socially anxious bastard"
Because different characters have different advantages. Why do questions like this still get asked?
Too busy being on that stupid ass mystery singer show
Don't cope
"Fucking monophanie looking ass floating with the dead, nice."
Nobody likes you
FUCKING READ IDIOT
Not really. My group of friends are awesome in every way possible except they are homophobic
People are barbaric even though they are peaceful? You‚Äôre not making any sense.
just ban everything!
HR is there to protect the company. Not you.
"[NAME] are the liars, we know."
She represents window licking retards.
Yeah no one is gonna do that and get reported to HR for bigotry.
r/vaxxhappened. Fuck you Jan.
That survival rate is skewed. It doesn't include the people who don't seek treatment because they can't afford it
Why should I get flayed? He's the one who sucks!
stupid science bitches
"Most people don't know the first thing about [NAME], so unsurprising."
Just saw your edit. What the crap. Guy was obviously creepy.
"It didn‚Äôt help [NAME]. He should have invested in a crosscut, it might have been a bigger challenge to put back together"
Yeah because streaming services don‚Äôt pay their artists well enough
oh stop IT
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking but doesn‚Äôt it sound super cool?!?
"Either you're very high, or don't know how to construct thoughts in the English language."
I related to [NAME] so much in this moment. I hate that [NAME] gone when he reaches for him.
I know this might be an unpopular opinion from reading this post but I have a gut feeling that [NAME] and [NAME] would pair up really well together.
"The weird part of our ""rivalry"" is that some people bought into it."
Until you provide a valid source nobody cares what your theory is. So it's downvoted.
"""Get the fuck out of the fucking chair"", or something to that avail."
Slightly too pissed off with this comment to merely downvote. Not angry enough to begin tirade. Lunchbreak ruined.
Who the hell is that. I only got my account 2 months ago
That is not the typical sexual dynamic in western cultures. That's a crazy asshole.
Can you fucking not
You don't hand your baby to perfect strangers in public. You keep them close and mitigate exposure to the best of your ability.
Someone who evidently doesn‚Äôt really know much about football or doesn‚Äôt do a simple google search before posting.
Politics in the KRG are some of the dumbest and most petty of the Middle East.
Not when it‚Äôs literally contradicted and not corroborated by every other one of that witnesses‚Äôs witnesses.
Ohhh you're an incel. Your opinion doesn't matter. Back in your hole smeegle
Who the hell thinks he isn‚Äôt overpaid
[NAME] doesn't get a vote [NAME]! Get the fuck out of here with this nonsense.
"Well, that sucks"
"makes no sense, troll harder"
"You're still going after this man, you posted from your alt account, give it up and take the L. It's not emasculating at all."
This is my biggest pet hate of all time!
Ok well I hate to break it to you but I'm a magical pink unicorn...posting something on the internet does not make it true
Well this is frustrating.
Its an unpopular opinion because it kind of makes you sound lika a douchebag and its lowkey homophobic edit:meant to reply to [NAME]
Hope not. That would be a bad decision.
That it just seems worst now because we have phones (instant media)
Same pigs who bombed a mosque full of kids learning Quran. In Shaa'Allah those terrorists will burn in hell
This keeps getting posted. I think not
Being a complete idiot and blocking a road in front of a bar. Which is where most cops tend to hang out trolling for DUIs at 2 am.
My ex asked me to tell her my steam password..... With more than 6000‚Ç¨ worth of stuff on it. No thanks.
That‚Äôs not a very humble opinion at all.
You're giving her too much credit.
"Not against us this season, apparently. "
You just defended him with a bunch of doublespeak bullshit so I‚Äôm gonna have to disagree. You‚Äôre a fucking idiot.
"> [NAME] My god we have to stop with some of these advanced statistics, it‚Äôs legit getting ridiculous. "
oppressed by nature!
"Also, the phone is set to another language than the one being spoken, which is a bit weird."

Maybe 2 years ago the time wasn't right for your relationship and now it is. It's been long enough to give it a second chance imo.
[NAME] a bastard man
Don‚Äôt like blood of the dead by the looks of it.
"Not true. Our knowledge of it is derived from the fossil record, which is geological."
"Shut the fuck up, loser."
I think the flairs get removed if a team hasn't been to a major in a certain amount of time. Don't quote me on that though.
Me too. Damn that damsel in distress syndrome
I don't generally find the CBO projections very accurate in retrospect. Some of their accounting practices and metrics seem error prone.
This fuck needs to sthaaaaap
That's not what follows from that at all.
How about as a whole we just hate snow
That sounds very sketchy to me. I would be thinking he‚Äôs with another girl TBH
"RDR singleplayer, not whatever the fuck that online is"
"No, a plot hole means that your story lacks logical consistency "
This makes me unfathomably angry.
That's because there are a lot of other attrocities that have happened since then. [NAME] aren't the only ones facing discrimination.
She doesn't have to pay anything this is just an opinion of a lawyer. No court ordered that.
> not broken I beg to differ.
Goddamn right!
Interesting. I‚Äôm very against the death penalty.
No...how dare you bring factual evidence into this conversation! /s
Fierljeppen heck!
Science damn you!

"For me, I tend to (over)share with friends, but also get offended at trivial questions like you."
"That was a brutal shift. Honestly he should be playing sheltered minutes. Team needs [NAME] and [NAME] back, give bulk of his minutes to [NAME]. "
"Me too, whenever my friends get with people I dont feel happy for them. I just feel envy and rage."
Aaaaaand they turned it off. Terrible roads everywhere.
It is bad tho.
They're wrong I don't like math and I'm still ugly
[NAME] is a traitor to this country.
As much as I don‚Äôt like his splits would have liked him on that contract that‚Äôs a huge miss for the dodgers imo.
Guys his username is [NAME]. I really don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs serious.
Stupid science bitch
You conveniently forgot nearly killing a toddler by throwing furniture out of a 14 story window.
Pretty sure they claimed he resisted arrest. If I remember correctly he was just peacefully sitting on the curb when the cops decided he was resisting.
No. It cannot. It's a dangerous fantasy (unironically)
Showering with someone feels more intimate than sex for me...and I don't like it.
We used to do a lot of terrible shit in the past that‚Äôs not a good argument
Imagine thinking that a rapist isn't deserving of prison. He's not even sorry.
Yet *I* get banned for saying you should downvote posts you don‚Äôt like. Fml
"Holy shit. I remember sleeping on the back window ""ledge"" in my parents' car! I haven't thought about that in years."
Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
Ouch! My hear sank. Don‚Äôt do this to me.
Why the fuck would I post something on r/niceguys and pretend to be the woman talking shit about myself?
Totally amazing that some peoples' egos can't even handle being honked at.
This will either be a classic or a complete shitshow
Wtf is this lmao god I hate reddit
What he said is entirely untrue fyi
I cannot help but get a sense of schadenfreude when a seemingly shitty person ruins their own career right before my eyes. ‚òïÔ∏è
Well damn.
[NAME] would've had to get lucky on that one. Can't give up that opportunity.
"""I lost control"" would have been an understandable explanation. ""It lost control"" is not. "

Not censoring usernames is against Reddit‚Äôs rules...
Cause as soon as he locked in execution he used the auto typing function immediately celebrating. Gets punished by karma and im the one down voted. Sure
I heard Netflix was cutting a bunch of content so I'm going to cancel and drop all the content myself! 4d chess move baby!
And the douche social media obsessed guy who left the used condom on the side table!

No just take care of your body!!! Fuck that
How dare you do [NAME] like this.
"So your sticking by the term ""extremist"" for this massive chunk of the population."
/s. There you go. I have magically inverted the meaning of my comment and removed all inconvenient truth from it
No. Can‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs legal here
"You can call me a bitch, and it's cool because you also aren't expecting me to pay you for doing it."
"If [NAME] loses I‚Äôll break my phone, [NAME] is fighting like wilder what the fuck is this comeback"
"No, but you wouldn't believe what I'm not tired of seeing..."
Why the fuck are you smiling for? Fuck you.
Mine is 2.5 and trying to drop her last nap. She needs it so desperately though. It is HELLLLLL dealing with this.
I can't even be mad that you scored a goal with your face.
Which three of you motherfuckers changed it from 666 upvotes when I clicked on this post?
Ooof. I have a hard time trusting asexuals who declare this information mid elationship.
You ever want to work so close with protocol and get blamed for changes in DV missions that were never communicated to you? Welcome to LRS!
"This is worse, Balo looks like a horse"
Censoring criticism and discussion is a very slippery slope.
About fucking time ordering ASAP
What in the hell are you talking about? I've never said that

Nothing about that looks comfortable

"Because the PS4 doesnt have any incredible exclusives? Edit: I was being sarcastic, please stop trying to teach me which games are good PS4 exclusives :("
I didn't say remain was left wing. I said the E.U acts as a buffer against the most insane and cruel Tory policies.
Feeling the hatred towards that person I get. Actually running them off the road and holding them at gunpoint? No way. No way to justify that.
"You fool, you have no idea that you talked about team fortress all along!"

">Emotions like this will get you killed. That is too bad, considering I was planning on living forever."
Glad I wasn‚Äôt the only who noticed. Annoyed me slightly.
"Eh, I'm not a fan of the grayscale. Looks too Kingsish. "
Not sure why you got downvoted so hard when everybody above is saying the same thing.
"Yes, he needs to sit the fuck down, that's all I have to say."

No. Not worth both whatsoever with what we need to fill
She's just going to suck you back in.
"Yeah, it‚Äôs just a pointless invasive comment when it‚Äôs coming from a stranger. "
He‚Äôd definitely get dropped at some point and then all hell will break loose
"Uncle [NAME], you dirty old man."
You've added nothing to this conversation and just repeated what everybody else. Thanks for wasting my time.
"I‚Äôd rather reply to you, simply because you sound like an idiot"
"Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad."
"Get em chief, fuck em, I find those people annoying as hell and I barely even use Instagram/twitter"
"No offense but you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Maybe you like neurotic, needy men, but the general populace does not."
its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30
i am retarded
[NAME] damn it I hate when enemy keepers use their hands and stuff to keep the ball outside their goal. Make a mistake pls.
Why irritated? I‚Äôm sure you said lots of nice stuff about [NAME] at the time.
"I guess your ex-fiance was different huh? That's really interesting. I've never had a fiance before, personally"

Stupid play.

Holy shit it's almost like the PYD is a organization of Syrian citizens I can't believe he exposed them on that.

"Shut up, Mag!"
"She'll ask them a question, interrupt them to say that something else is coming up and then talk about something irrelevant. She is all over the place."
Literally right after I sent it. What the hell
"No, not at all."
That legitimately made me nauseous.
there is no compromise with people who hold the American people hostage for something the American people don't want. don't negotiate with terrorists.

"I dont think a murder log that survived what killed off trex counts as cute, even if its only 2 or 3m long. "

Pretty unlikely as those polls are worthless. Also there is no way GOP/Trump would have supported [NAME] over [NAME] if they thought he was the stronger of the two
"Yes, the Raptors need to stop committing dumb fouls."
I'm leaving to go get some more motherfucking jokes MOM [NAME]
You have to be trolling because I doubt you‚Äôre this dumb.

If [NAME] is lurking here it's probably definitely not good for his issues
0% But then again most of us on here aren't placing top 8 at majors so that could factor in
Braindead people blocking lane is pure cancer. But the most horrible part of your story is that you got stuck in checkline line for 10 sore minutes.. Wow.

I wish I could tell you if it was a good t.v. Let me just find the MOTHERFUCKING REMOTE!!!!!!!!
She must hate her father.
"Ah the classic ""I don't deserve you"" argument."
This argument makes zero sense. The same tax exclusions and exemptions that were around when the marginal rate was at 90 are not around today.
Averaging 12-14 off the bench isn‚Äôt nothing
He mustn't know about Mr. [NAME] and the cause of his untimely death.
As a contractor this is a huge nono. If it's not on paper it not on your wall either.
Next time something like this happens tell them it's illegal to pet a working service dog and they could be sent to jail for it

"hi [NAME], toxicity in a multiplayer game is something that should always be expected no matter the game cause people are assholes."
"Sorry what, seriously? Who decided that shit, that wasn't even [NAME]?"
"I hate to sound like we're in a Santa Monica coffee shop, but keto diets are incredibly effective if you can stick to it"
You can't demand historical accuracy 'at all' then. It's logical fallacy.
Because it's incredibly cringy.
No. Being a private investigator isn't illegal.
"Even if you don't act on them, you still should stay away. It's not normal to fantasize about doing sexual things to children."
She sucks but you don‚Äôt sound much better
"This is a test, now YOU have to give away that gold. Your donor was a cruel benefactor. "
Don't grab another slice of pizza. Maybe if they would've eaten the crust they would have not been so hungry. It's greedy and picky.
"They‚Äôre not pissed off to the point where they‚Äôre actually going anywhere else, and that‚Äôs just crunching numbers."
when only rich people got elected and passed laws...
Don't make me talk about [NAME]... ...
This is the dumbest post I've read today. How's that?
That isnt sustainable.
Win what exactly? A meaningless game in a very long season to be swept out of the playoffs? No thanks.
In the comments he accuses the account of being fake and she proves her identity with photos and a link to her instagram. This guy is astoundingly pathetic.
Well no dur
that's not scarcity its desperation and prioritizing looks over everything else
"Considering that the picture OP jerked was fake and that the OP of the faked picture was rude as fuck to absolutely EVERYONE, that‚Äôs completely false. "
"No, thats just the glare from the sun"
"He was playing with absolute garbage teammates, and the one year he was on a decent team he had 44 points in 48 games. "
"My girlfriend barely tolerates me showering in the morning, she'd be furious if I'd let an alarm ring while I'm away. And rightfully so. "
FUCKING NORMIES REEEEEEEEE
"I mean I love [NAME] as a player, but emotional attachment aside, we really need a consistent shooter "
Professionally.... no way I could do that to myself
*ads even more trashier
[NAME] was attractive physically and got a match. [NAME] wasn't unattractive in his behavior and got an invitation for sex.
You're delusional
Man I hate kids
I don‚Äôt get why you don‚Äôt post that hog.
"You fucking got this bb, one step at a time. The DD is here for you."
If somebody is fundamentally unsocialized chances are they behave socially inappropriate in more than one situation
Protip- just smell your damn food. Use your senses!
Fuck with these giveaways.
"You sure are outraged about some people making fun of [NAME]. Gee, that's easy!"
"I used to sell appliance parts. Yes, I need your model number. No, the part you are looking for isn't ""standard."""
"It's a dumb and harmful thing, when you invite people because of their race and sexual orientation over qualifications and skill"
only facts mate - so nothing you would be interested in
Black people still get shot unarmed. Comparing suffering is stupid and pointless.
It's a waste of water to shower that often.
This why we can‚Äôt have nice things! I would‚Äôve beat him up for taking with my non-existent mans away üò§
I can guarantee you for many the hate for this administration started much before the election results were in.
You have no legs to stand on to accuse me of such.
Why is sleeping with a coworker such a big problem for a news network? It‚Äôs not the military with a rank disparity or something
We are going with Godsey. This team is so dumb.
I hate the way [NAME] kisses people. Like smushing his face in a figure 8 on their lips. Ugh
>!Cosplayer Bystander!<: I always knew he was a little bitch.
"No, I‚Äôm saying that ‚Äúnot getting an abortion‚Äù is the default option, and takes less deliberate effort than getting an abortion."
"Ugh I never thought I'd be someone that gets jealous about shoes, which ones did you get?"
"There. Are. No. Moderate. Republicans. Repeat this, nonstop, everytime she is mentioned. She is an extremist who pretends to be moderate."
"Nope, not really"
Not having sex doesn't mean you can't talk about it especially if the ultimate goal is proper coexistence.
"It can get ridiculous ,too. She'll actually yell out ""stop yelling!!!"" when she's the only one yelling."
You are reduced to attacking men for their biology.
That was intentional as fuck. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could argue that after that insane contortionist layup over [NAME] last week.
I‚Äôm just shitposting dude. In the spirit of the thread ‚ÄúI was bored‚Äù
He's done nothing to earn trust either. He got ran out of Miami
I don‚Äôt think you are comprehending what I‚Äôm saying.
See this is why they should merge r/forhonor and r/forhonormemes cause clearly it makes no difference what subreddit it‚Äôs on
Pretty sure it‚Äôs going on in the apartment across from me right now. My neighbors are trashy
Why are you so fucking concerned with what someone else uses to clean their teeth? You sound like a toothpaste troll.
Our federal budget is $4 trillion. Until entitlements are reformed the arguments over what things cost is irrelevant.
That's ignorant as all hell. Tell them to buy their own.
That‚Äôs not how totaling works.
Smoking a pipe whilst laying some pipe. Fantastic.
100% scam
That boy ain‚Äôt right
your first mistake was trying to make something look presentable while serving it in a tupperware
"The new beserker face ruined him for me. Made him another old, wrinkly hobo."
Your comment is completely irrelevant and you're trolling me in order for you to cry and whine about Detroit. Get out of here.
She shouldn‚Äôt have to fight a male.
I must of not fully understood what you meant... damn tired redditing
Kraft is the wrong kind of ass though. Even the generic stuff is better than kraft.
Because men are weak/stupid enough to let them.
"Both good and not so good, but mostly good! You should DESTROY HER. NOBODY NEEDS TO TAKE UP THAT MUCH SPACE ON THE CURB. "
It was so frustrating seeing him overthrow people every week. I hope he makes that a point of focus this off-season.
I think you didn't read the whole post. Go to the eye doctor.
"Fuck me, that is good. "
"I'm not ready, I'm not ready, I'm REALLY not ready."

shucci a lil BITCH
Ugh sucker punch

Avoid Blount St and Martin Luthur King or risk death. I‚Äôm not kidding.

This isnt a excuse. It affected their start last yr also.
He has become that which he swore to destroy!

"I was already taking a break from basketball this season, but I think this really put the final nail in the coffin. This team is hopeless. "
[NAME] is just another millionaire taking advantage of dumb people.
How the fuck is that not ticketable.
"**Zigzagzigal-type Balance Suggeestions** - I feel like you are flying, why not get into a war with China who, because they had no alternatives."

You crush them up
"Claims to be ""against sexist [NAME] bros"" Hires a sexual abuser as her top advisor"
you are delucional.
YOU BLEEPING NEED ME! YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SUB GREAT WITHOUT ME!
Define abuse. People can down vote as they see fit but it doesn't mean it has to ruin your day.
"Translation: ""I have no argument so here's a rude comment""."
It‚Äôs crazy that people know this and yet rake [NAME] over the coals for not wanting to talk to [NAME].
BITCOIN SEND MONEY INSTANTLY (waits 6 months to get money and still praises site)
Where is that damn SaLt LiCK
Yeah I don't think [NAME] even had to move his hands for that one. [NAME] and [NAME] also destroyed the precision QB challenge too.
Sucking [NAME] pecker! They're no respect for your dignity! Suck it!!!!
How dare you not find domestic abuse funny! /s

The parallel to the mistake you're making is so apparent I no longer believe you're discussing this in good faith.
Burn through ALL THE DATA
Gawd but [NAME] is a bitch.
Why not touch them? then don't shove people out of lifts. that's hardly civil. just WAIT and let people get off.

Theesomes won't make someone monogamous more open to solo stuff.

Wait so the aboleth only kills you if you dont do what the dm says
"Fuuuck, brutal"
Pro? Everyone does is and that makes it even more rude.
I hate watching [NAME] play I can tell before he steps over half when he‚Äôs gunna shoot or pass. His BB IQ is atrocious

Women can't do wrong you fucking mansplainer

This does not sound like a good situation for a child at all imo.
"As per, they‚Äôre being slammed on social media. Their response and justification of it being from seven years ago is contrary and lame."
Of course. Just know that I know that you know you're a liar.
[NAME] playing sloppy
Calm down. What the hell. I just tryed to tell you that there MEIGHT be a different side to that story.
So wrong. Most every denomination believes they are the only ones who are doing it right and everyone else is going to rot in hell.
She looks so corrupt... Same with [NAME]
Nope. This guy is legitimately this dumb.
"I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. "

"You guys are heartless, smfh."

"Who said anyone was white or black? Forget it, trumpie. You clowns don‚Äôt care about the truth. "

"Damn, she was gonna clobber that punk with the butt of that gun."
Not necessarily. Simply giving both of them the legal right to choose to *not* be a parent would create equality within the constraints of biology.
"Fuck the people that couldn't make rent, pay bills or medical costs because of the shutdown, right?"
Holy shit he hit him hard
Champaign‚Äôs a weird town in that aspect..

"I couldn‚Äôt imagine putting a brand new car on these roads, let alone a Tesla."
I dare each or any of you fuckasses to try and blame [NAME] for this one
I regret my psycho ex. Does that mean I was raped? Or do the rules not apply because I'm a man?
"I don't think this is bad enough for the police chief to be embarrassed. (He should be, but he won't be)"
Tell him he needs to go to rehab or he‚Äôll be kicked out.
We do? Strong disagree.
"not really. but those people that go out of their way to say stuff like ""have a blessed day"" or whatever kinda creep me out. "
It's the wisdom of the fool.
> lots of ppl dont enjoy pvp I feel like these people are playing the wrong game genres lol.
Star Wars fans? Backlash? Nah.
"no it doesn't, hmmmm I sent in an ask on the discord support page about finding people so lemme check that"

You don't get it man

*I hate laughing!*
"So having a baby you don‚Äôt want is [NAME] will, but having a baby you do want is going to put you in hell? "
SWTOR is horrible when you want to play together with someone. So many parts that you can't join in on.
"Not any harder than in chicken wings, imho."
I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.
Well then you obviously have no fucking clue what equality means.
"Lol it's not a bad dance, what's cringe worthy is people getting so upset over a video game "
As if they're going to go through that much effort... they wont even walk up the stairs to get to the box
"And she jumped into sewage. Yeh, no."
Don't date broke/jobless women. I have a job and I always offer to pay the bill or split.
You can't just ignore [NAME]' cup wins though.
Fair. Actually fuck the last few songs on Bleach.
Captain you ARE wrong. You‚Äôre wrong nooption to argue. I have the final rule ! Nope not gonna listen.
"I'm a Broncos fan. I'll never, ever root for the Chargers, Chiefs or Raiders. Who the fuck would? "
Shut up and stop trolling. You're not funny
Don't be an asshole
It's a shame they have [NAME] because a Vuc package would be ideal
Wtf is a weeb
I'm jealous. Wish I was in fl on my porch.
This game and it‚Äôs updates can be very frustrating sometimes. We already discuss the issues to death but meme Monday has been oddly therapeutic
that dude steals so many tweets. i hate him
Why don‚Äôt people just call the cops and give them the video?
Mate it's been nice the last couple weeks. You're gonna die when a stormy period arrives.

A Wall is NOT a Volition of the NAP you idiot.

I think thats dumb and simplistic. You really can't boil down the sociology of race by comparing it to 2+2=4.
Well. Good... they should know they've pissed me off
PayPal is fucking pricey. 500 bucks to Mexico cost me 60$
Im retarded lmao Etiz/flualp
What? No way do I want to see a Boston coach behind our bench!
I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more!
I can't tell if you're serious.
Yep. It's pretty bad having to use work or a paid email and real name on a gaming forum.
"I‚Äôve never heard of their football team, must be fake news /s"
[NAME] what a stupid job
"I partly disagree. In an argument that stupid, whoever writes more text than the other person is inevitably the bigger moron."
"Ooh wrong answer, but you'll have another chance to win 10,000 dollars in the lighting round! Will be right back after these messages."
Fuck calm down [NAME]

[NAME] in the Lego movie? Get outta here
"When the caterer found out [NAME] was going to pay the bill out of his own pocket, perhaps they declined the honour."
Sooo inappropriate and sooo awkward. He looked so uncomfortable and [NAME] wouldn't stop. I hated watching that scene.
Misandry is not part of our feminism here. Don‚Äôt make such comments again.
These people in here are joking about holding down and cutting their neighbors faces. It's pretty gross.
Leave the guy alone he‚Äôs making sidewalk angels
You're giving fascism too much credit here. They were backed by capitalists in the first place because it was profitable. It's those two together.
That sucks. You could start one yourself if you like.
"Guilty Gear actually did that before with Guilty Gear Isuka. It was, uh...not good. Really fuck-awful, actually. "

"It was the only thing that changed. The weight gain, terrible acne, and moods... it was all nasty."
I hated that smug ass lawyer.
They're not the brightest bunch.
"[NAME] turned it into one, because they insisnt on being on the wrong side of history for every single god damn issue."
It is though. Certainly the worst Zelda game at least.
"There have been multiple threads about this, they can't afford to move up. It's not financially feasible."
"I'll say no thanks to endangering others in traffic. And miss me with the ""I drive better while high"""
Crafty little bastards.

"As someone who works in the oil industry with a lot of big ships, this is badass."
I hate this arm swing thing. Either try to sync up or just stop doing it.
I'll kill you.
"Ah yes, the merge from 640 to 40 by papermill. Idiots do this all the time. It really messes up the traffic pattern. "
"No, but it diverts resources from the art team, and prevents them from making content which would have been better recieved by the already low playerbase!"
So why did [NAME] leave? They were predictable and mostly tolerable. Three wings is absolutely intolerable. I hate him.
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS!!!
BITCH HER PROMO EVEN DID SCREAMS LIKE A WINNER!!!!
That‚Äôs horrible. I‚Äôm probably going to donate to them I can‚Äôt imagine not missing out on a season because someone stole.

"C'mon baby, C'MON DEEP SHIT"
"You're not wrong, [NAME], you're just an asshole."
"Yeah, but geology doesn‚Äôt provide enough pumped hydro. Not enough places to do it."
My goodness. Your such a fucking manchild.
this is so niche but i still felt that shit in my bones
I don't know about the rain but my friend suggested that it could look a tiny bit like Malachor.
I‚Äôm gonna stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes! Maybe that‚Äôll teach you a lesson.
Did you have to ask? Just pay the ticket and be done with it.
Looks like a plate to me. A stupid plate. But a plate nonetheless.
"Afro samurai lol, that's pretty interesting never new they actually existed. I'm woman though so that wouldn't work for me "
He was a bony old bastard and probably jealous of their big cat energy.
Or just head on to Galleon's Grave. I just hate Dagger Tooth.
"Eh, Level 7 is pretty serious. Give me my Massif and I'll survive anything."
He can‚Äôt be like that in that business but it already sounds too late. No wonder his staff quit on him.
I hate y'all too
This is just a stupid question. The answer is who cares? [NAME] is on an entirely different level from [NAME].
I've been playing for years and it's still a bitch for me to lay off balls.

The Birds is probably not quite what you are expecting.

[NAME] i want to slap the shit out of her
"Watch out, [NAME]!! [NAME] is right behind you. Oh god oh fuck he can‚Äôt hear us, he has AirPods."
He's transcended fuck-you-money to fuck-me-money territory
Why was nobody driving the damn thing? They were all in the backseat. :/
It's not collapsing
What the fuck did I just read?
Ouh shittt my dad is also going to be surprised

I was freaking out watching this. WTF are the parents!?
Bitch ass n*** [NAME] rooting for [NAME]
Confronting people with footage from slaughter houses is a horrible thing to do in my opinion.
I heard this was because of a bill that happens to go in affect during the Government shutdown.
You're taking all of this WAY too literally AND making a lot of assumptions.
In case anyone is questioning...the title is sarcastic.

"Depends on who rates you. They don't all do it. I stayed at 5 till about 40 delivery, then it started moving around alot."
"._. yeah, the man is doing something wrong if we feel nothing."
I don't think you should expect solid logic out of someone who believes [NAME] exists.
"Matinee games should not be allowed for us anymore, we‚Äôre terrible at matinee games"
"TTs have size limits. The group I was acquainted with had, ahem, ""leadership"" problems as well."
That guy‚Äôs an asshole. He behavior doesn‚Äôt inherently have anything to do with poly.
"Ad hominem. Ridiculous argument, not even funny or hilarious."
"Dude, wtf is this?"

I‚Äôm tired of these stupid posts. Stop trying to become a meme. You‚Äôre ruining this sub!
Downvoted because I stated facts ok...
yeah but we really don‚Äôt want to be like them. it is an example of failed communism turned militaristic authoritarianism
"That's far more expensive than, you know, recycling it..."
As someone else has mentioned it is not theft technically. So that will probably only cause more problems for myself.
And there's good reason for that. The SD is absolute shit
I don't think we could afford the expense bill for coming out of a pretty cushy retirement.
Stupid theory!
I am not running around talking about how I am going to beat up my kids teachers. Not sure where you got tough guy from that...

Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car.
"Doesn‚Äôt offend me, I just don‚Äôt like looking at it. "
Can't fire everyone if everyone is on strike.

I really hope that's true and really hope they grow some balls and ban it.
There's doing stupid things when you're young. Then there's doing horribly stupid things when you're in your mid-30s and you're already active in Politics
"ASMR is a weird sexual fetish for incels, and dont let anyone try and convince you otherwise."
Fuck these trendy hipster joints. Give me my shit like normal fucking people.
It is. I bet chantex and all the other 'quit smoking' companies hope this book doesn't become too popular. That would cut into their profits.
[NAME] was half-blood but it wasn't a smart idea to bring up his father.
What are you talking about? Anything bad that happened was [NAME] fault - only good things were [NAME] doing!
