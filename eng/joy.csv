R/sleeptrain Might be time for some sleep training. Take a look and try to feel out what's right for your family.
Thank you friend
"Super, thanks"
Happy to be able to help.
Famous for his 3-4 Defense
"aw, thanks! I appreciate that! "
Thanks! I love watching him every week

You just make her sound awesome.
i wouldn't take that significant of a pay cut. you should keep your job and do your creative writing on the side/free time.
Thanks I'll give it a go. Nothing used for randoms at all? Would it be better for me to find a group to play with?
I appreciate his deadpan humour.
It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
You seem slightly sensitive... I was actually thinking we had been infiltrated by the normies
Tournament was a blast met some really cool people loved it all. Thanks for holding it. Would love to do it again someday
"Yeah, I am! I'll private message you a link to my profile. Thank you."
Yeah let's wrap up AS4 I'm suddenly so much more excited for S11
"Absolutely. I'd love it. No matter how much I like the guy, if he just goes for it that's not cool."
Glad to see Hearts fans giving [NAME] such a warm welcome back..
"Glad you feel better! My offer still stands though, if you need someone, I‚Äôm here"
"Lol so petty, I kinda love it. I probably wouldn‚Äôt actually do that but it‚Äôs tempting."

The first time I'm seeing it so thank you for sharing. Definitely shows the propaganda efforts.

It's also one of the very few decent solo FPS released this year.

That's the kind of problem a physical therapist is more qualified to handle. Good luck
Thank you so much! I love Germany! I was in Berlin 2 years ago for research work.
I had no idea what the fuck this was about. Found the ad and watched it. It's actually decent.
"I'm sorry OP, every single thing on that list is incredibly wrong. I hope you're doing well now. "
She has at least 12 elbows and all of them are happy. You get it gurl
"Yes, it's normal. More like considering you options than desperation"
They look absolutely PERFECT together. I hope its that way in real life too. So happy for ya [NAME]!!!
Gamers know all too well how it feels to be oppressed by society.
It's extremely common. Hell you probably have it yourself and just don't know.
"Lol, get em Corsi! "
Sounds nice owo
"Lol, that‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôll have to find our Aggieopoly and see how it compares."

Thank you SO much! This is so genuine and so helpful. Thank you so much for your time and your thoughts.
"hey thank you! any time I can help someone, I'm more than happy to:)"
"Ah, thank you"
Season 2 just started and as a huge TNG fan I can definitely say the first season is the closest I've ever seen to another season of TNG
It makes us more determined to tank for Zion
"I love it! A smile from a stranger has really turned my day around, so I always hope I can possibly do the same! "
the number 9 recruit from the 2019 class at USC has already entered the transfer portal lol it's only been like 3 weeks man give it a chance
I have his signature on my jersey. Lined up at Canadian Tire for it when I was younger. Happy retirement!
I am just like this! Glad to know I‚Äôm not imagining it.
Oh yeah! He was great for us. 0.69 ERA in 24 G with 10.7 K/9. I forgot about him.
I hope for the camera-man's sake that gun is empty
Holy shit this golden comment flew under the radar. I laughed so hard
"I hope she lives to be 200, just to piss them off."
Eventually sure. But the question really lacked the maybe later option lol
I have dayz but haven‚Äôt played in years. Last I heard it‚Äôs still a broken mess lol.

I like it!
"Thank you, needed to hear this today! "
"They aren't horrible in the least bit. Just learn from your mistake, remember, and move on. That's all you can do."
"MEEEEEEEEE. Most people don't get my humour, but every now and then somebody does and we non-stop laugh together. "
you might be more of an optimist than me. hopefully you're right
Good news: this is shark tale not finding Nemo
The only reason people are there is because they dont know [NAME] is fired lmao.
"[NAME] has to lose it a some point, just hope it's not tonight."
Cheers to you on your cake day.

Their orange chicken is the absolute fucking bomb. I love having it on top of a nice bed of rice and veggies :D
"Klokslag 12 I find really enjoyable, horror movie podcast, Im not a horror fan but I find these dudes very entertaining"
Good for [NAME]. He deserves it.
Omg so glad I‚Äôm not alone
Yeah no haha. Out of my price range tbh
"Congrats, still waiting on getting called for an interview for another internal position. Applying around Christmas HR is so fucking slow."
Wholesome and hilarious! Good job OP.
That was brilliant üòÇ
I'm so excited for this game!! üòÑ
Focus on yourself by focusing on your prayers and reminding [NAME]
"So true, sometimes what‚Äôs obvious passes over our heads. Good post."
"Yup. You see more hands, have to learn more to be competitive.. etc"
Yeah but even then I feel like they could‚Äôve went about it better
"Lol, ..probably not. But then again, i never wanted to know what blue waffles were and somehow i do. "
"**GOD DAMN YOU, FIGHT BACK!!**"
The impact of his head hitting the court looked so bad. I hope he'll recover from this.
congrats. i'm broken rn but if I wasn't I'd be happy for you
My Dachshund loves trying to lick my son's mouth when he's laughing. Every single time.
"Lol don't worry, they even make you somehow hate [NAME] in season 2."
100%. She's made herself vulnerable to being sued by a few people.
You‚Äôre right. Thank you for the context and information.
"I appreciate this post, so it‚Äôs appropriate in my eyes üòÄ"
Mostly because of the hype. I love going out with my friends!
Fuck is exactly what she's good for
"Sure you are, comrade. You've met your quota of replies now, yes?"
Well good...opera is often beautiful..though it retains the stink of the upper classes.. I cant help but deride art that caters to high society to stay alive.
PLACE THE DEVICE ON HER HEAD HA HA HA TIME TO DIE
I took a picture of the sunrise this morning too. Just north of Austin. It was very pretty today.
"You just gotta man up, go out there, and get that kiss."
Yeah he's a real one. I would've loved him coaching the Broncos
This really bothers me too. I completely agree. It would have helped us avoid a US situation. Now I think we're barreling toward it
Nice job building yourself btw
Yeah highkey looks decent
You are sexy af
"I‚Äôm glad things are coming to light, I pray justice is served for the victims. "
> lack of diversity in the cast now that's a new one lmao
Thanks. I appreciate that. At least I know I‚Äôm not the only one.
I have been doing that. The disc-to-digital thing is pretty sweet.
You're most welcome!
Haha this dude‚Äôs from the area I‚Äôm from. He‚Äôs a local treasure
Really wish we had got something like this!
[NAME] looks queasy already I like where this is going
I want to go back in time and hug you as a child (after you got the lice treated tho).
I've been there. It's one of the most diverse places on Earth.
Me too. I love it!
That uncle was awesome.
Also available on Spotify and Apple Music. Any feedback would be hugely appreciated!
Brave soul.
"[NAME], [NAME] is the most underrated [NAME]. I love that guy. "
I think [NAME] could've been a long term quality backup. We really should have hung onto him and ejected [NAME] like a bad habit.
Lol I love this flair
Finally gonna get together with [NAME]. Love is beautiful.
The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won‚Äôt witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.
I like that idea!
My coffee burned its way through my nostrils. Thank you!
Good luck [NAME]
"Oh, I thought it was about the audio glitch at the end, lol Now I see "

This is badass. I'd love to see it placed over war pigs. Amazing work OP
I love this. Now I'm craving tacos in the morning.
yeah dude I love my 9(???) with the welded bump stock
Mate you're talking to a Remainer who wants to Remain... I just want a Labour Government that's all.
"this is a truly remarkable and informative documentary, and well worth setting aside an evening to watch. "
"I don't know how that works, but it's definitive that it will happen on that date."
Everyday for the last year and a half has been very hard and I should be glad she's gone. I'm almost there.
Understandable. Thank you for your opinion. Ill move towards due action soon.
Yea having children will always solve the problem
It‚Äôs fun until you‚Äôre looking back

"it's simple, it's stupid, and I can't stop laughing. 10/10"
Nice try with your 1/3 pan and t rex arms there buckaroo /s
Either of those scenarios make sense. I'm getting antsy I need some positive Steelers news haha.
At least we know they have good taste
radical would be good. Poverty has to be erased before society is allowed to maximize individual wealth as it is doing now.
Democrips & Rebloodicans was my favorite.
I like [NAME] so far but making shots that you missed in the first half aren't coaching adjustments
Okay I can see this looking really cool for a festival or photos though üòÑ
"I became a member in the summer and have still not gotten my packet, your post just gave me hope it still might come"
This is my favorite game of all time. Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
I agree. That is a fight better left for later.
I know how you feel and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through that. But I‚Äôm glad you are still here
And then everyone clapped and cheered.
I enjoyed this TED talk.
He's trying!
I know! I would absolutely do this as well. I‚Äôd love to to a AMA with him to find out more.
Im sure shell last 5 min
"the NT-242 is my favorite battlefront weapon, by far."
Actually [NAME] had the #1 PP who bazooka [NAME] fired lol
Oh yeah. That character could have had potential if they let him develop properly
I loved this place but I would only go for the big Blockbusters. It was the best IMAX theater in Minnesota hands down RIP
"In the short term, yes. "
"Easy money, thank you [NAME]"
"I mean, two times zero is zero and that can be a guarantee :D"
hmmmmm I still love [NAME] and a lot of OR candidates but thank you
It‚Äôs an 05 and we don‚Äôt know when the battery was last repacked lol
He looks especially cute in the glasses.
Would need the #1 overall in 2 years... should try to get a first in next years draft for AB and hope that team tanks
"He probably does, but people don‚Äôt speak Godlish very well."
Haha I meant [NAME]. I was a very chatty fast bowler/no.6 pinch hitter.
I hope his pants fell down from the extra weight lmao
"Thank you for your concern, fellow conservative"
Always great to see a fellow [NAME] give proper advice
genuinely funny - downvoted
Thank you for phrasing it in a way where I picture [NAME] leaning over a school bus seat to tell me that.
"Tbh, 2020 he would give us another amazing album. This year could still be rushed, but it‚Äôs great to see him out and shit"
That‚Äôs my favorite way to introduce myself tbh
This is a great thread for catching up on my block list. 10/10 would block again
I didn‚Äôt rely on them necessarily. I just dislike chiefs and [NAME] lol
Lol he said it was the driver's fault and everyone called him out.
That‚Äôs the most badass joke I‚Äôve heard
I love this üòÇ
"Your pro controller tho, tops."
[NAME] it'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic.
"Plot twist, she's accepted [NAME] as her Lord and Savior."
"Yeah but that post is a day old so OP won't have any chance of getting karma off it, cmmon now"
Whoops. Didn‚Äôt know that was a thing. Thanks!
That‚Äôs how I read it in the sentence but my brain reads it as ‚Äúyeahno‚Äù. Lol
As much as I hate [NAME] I love the guy a lot
You're right... But look at that badass black leather jacket.
i mean yeah but people need to understand when someone needs something other than just sexual comments and maybe some actual support
money always talk. i want more to learn from this lesson.
Thanks for explaining the point he was making.
This actually made me laugh out loud
"To me, the best smell a person can have is just a clean smell. "
Ha! I like that one.
I like this kid
Hahaha damn.
[NAME] has a fun instagram
Pretty sure their subreddit makes one of these for every game. They're pretty legit.
"Funny, coming from the tool circle jerk reddit."
Easy on the Granville Island gatekeeping amigo. Its absolutely a tourist destination.
"That comment about ""kill him with kindness"" was kinda unnecessary. How about just kindness for kindness sake? lol"
It's holiday time here in Europe. Today is my first day in work for 2 weeks.
"No no no, the ball was tipped. He‚Äôs a great kicker"
Spending the day with family in beautiful Bowral üåø
The guest judges these last two episodes are so gorgeousss like really
Why do you use your valuable time to hate? We only got time to love each other and ourselves.
Thank [NAME] for your mother and her googling skills! Now if you have kids you know who allowed and welcome to be around them and who not.
"Pretend you are the lead in a movie. You will probably get laid, confidence is everything. Bingo bango, great night!"
"I read this place obsessively and didn't see it, so I'm enjoying it and upvoting it anyway"
Man I love listening to [NAME] talk and I‚Äôd love to have a chat with him but he does talk some bollocks sometimes.
Great reply as usual
"Thank you for doing these, i wanna learn our prospects more and this helps"
üòÖ thanks bew bew
For me it's more about making my personal appearance a hobby more than just buying expensive stuff to have it
"I agree, it would be a bore if everybody agreed with everyone else. "
My type of cheerleader. Those are some good looking guys
That solves it. Thank you!
Try to keep yourself busy with other things to forget the thoughts.
[NAME] is gorgeous and so are you.
"Looks nice, thanks:) "
All good üëç
"He‚Äôs a coward, but no need to ruin his life. You should feel sorry for him. "
"Where I live this standard, however they would of only been together just three weeks. Great news for you guys thou."
"Really glad the US just passed transparent pricing for healthcare providers, but it's just a first step."
"You‚Äôre right, I was thinking of AiG or the Discovery Institute. "
Thanks! That was an interesting read. Seems there really is a city where they built more homes than there were people to live there!
So glad to hear that! you go girl<3
I wanna give [NAME] a mosquito bite
It sounds like you'd have a great time with Final Fantasy XIV.
"Their faces tho, LOL"
I like that he keeps with the Cardinals‚Äô colors. This needs to be an alternative uniform
"Laugh all you want, it's pretty much indestructible now!"
I wish my mom was catgirl savvy.

"I really hope more queer couples have kids. It needs to become more normalized. I definitely want at least 2, probably through surrogacy."
Agreed. Sometimes you just have to move forward and let those determined to be left behind have their wish.
"Block the number, avoid your parents, and cut the toxic people out of your life."
I LOVE THE HIGHS TOO. At least I know tomorrow I will hate them. Is the good worth the bad? Sometimes...
That... That makes a lot more sense than what I thought they were chanting.
Greetings fellow human
‚ô´ Your love for me Won't be quite the same When you take a whiff Of my hershey stains. ‚ô´
"I‚Äôve always loved the art style of the author/illustrator as a kid, so I could see where you‚Äôre coming from."

"Wow, impressive... And how long until it breaks and they decide it's not worth repairing?"
"If there‚Äôs a pattern, yes."
He‚Äôs a brave man.

I'm glad we have a place we can come to when we have doubts. Thank you so much.

That is the coolest name
Damn that's a good-looking pizza
[NAME] would laugh and hang up if this was the offer
Be careful with the Washington Times. It's not exactly the Washington Post.
because it's a morning ritual and i like the smell and taste
I think it's your choice that determines it
I'm mostly impressed that you can get to work from West Seattle in 20 minutes by car.
You are the only real person i can look at soo noo
Lol no wonder it's so expensive. I've been wondering if his developers are taking him for a ride.
Excellent use of this scene. Your skills and taste border on wizardry.

"If you‚Äôre concerned about [NAME], then you must still be concerned about [NAME]. WAR over last 2 seasons: [NAME]: 4.8, 3.1 [NAME]: 4.0, 3.6"

And dedmon is expiring. So he likely would have walked for nothing. Huge win
It's normal school except they sexually identify as [RELIGION]
Galaxy brained hot take Your IQ must be near [NAME] levels of hyperinteligence

I am glad your okay.
I actually have an odd feeling the game will become even more fun than before.
Unite us. Unite the clans.
Wow. All that up and down cycling. These people must feel 80 by the time they're 30.
"Dude! Coyotes are no joke. Good job, [NAME]. "

"If we hurry, we can still catch the heroin craze! "
Agree with [NAME] and yang I only really liked [NAME] for a little bit she irritated me
In draft I see a lot of enchantress. Even without Enchantress if Lodestone Demolition gets 6 dmg(same as Lightning Strike) I am happy.
Sometimes it‚Äôs annoying but I think it‚Äôs at an okay place right now
Samsies! I could have written the feels in this post. It's like the job I never ever wanted and got and now I've tenure
I could not agree with you more! These selfish women crying abuse to manipulate.
Achilios too good
[NAME] way of doing things is straight trash for [NAME] lol. The latter end of the competition being bottom is a default sometimes.
It's all fun and games until your crush turns into a spaceship.
One of our favorite rides.

Wow that was ...mind blowing.
Props to the guy for being honest
"He, like [NAME] and [NAME], are better in the latter halves of seasons. Let's see if he can do some damage."
"I freakin‚Äô love doing this, too!!! Makes me happy for a second or two!"
"Whenever I'm having a bad day, I watch a few eps of Cosmos to chill out."
I thought that phrase was only used for memes now lol at least that's what I got from Vic deals
I love in SoSpaHa - south of Spanish Harlem.
"Dude awesome job being the reading police, great work out there tonight. Keeping the streets safe."
Lol you wish it was that easy. Lying POS customers have the advantage with review websites sadly.
"Thanks everyone for your feedback! Dosing one bottle tomorrow night around 8pm EST, will post back with results ü§†"
I don't think you see it in the flames sub... if you do it's probably a joke
This will pass and you will be happy again. Just not right now. Hang in there.

This version of mass destruction is by far my favorite

Awesome! Thanks for your reply
That's awesome. Hahaha
I feel like someone smart will go pound bama on the ML right now. But that person won‚Äôt be me lol.
"Been with ethnic girls, blondes, brunettes, and a fake red head. No correlation. "
I love this comment
So fucking awesome. Cheers from Brazil.

"I would never tell anyone stick is better than pad, but speaking personally, it's way more fun"
He is and will be irrelevant. No worries.
"Thank you for the advice. I was thinking it was envy, and I needed some place to get advice from some strangers."
Could they have written a more uninspiring Press Release. Hopefully it is more about [NAME] than [NAME] and [NAME].
"Thanks I‚Äôm falling in love, and it‚Äôs also cost efficient!"
It's going to hit all of us but there it is : no deal. It's high time to accept reality.
It really is! I loved everything about it. I'm so happy my friend told me about the franchise :)
"oh, me too, actually."
The NEW & IMPROVED Doggy Slinky!!! Everyone loves a Slinky!
"Also the sneezing. The dog is sneezing which is canine for ""this is a great game"""

Omg that‚Äôs a perfect idea! I obviously want to avoid the stalker thing but I do love basketball and understand it so this seems possible
thank you!
Wow. Thank you so much. I really appreciate this.
"I agree with this. I'm extremely happy with the hires, but I think the draft may be a bigger tell tale on how the off-season goes."
Well I mean he got erased from existence twice and is still here so I'm guessing it has to be something more than that.
Yeah that doesn't sound fun at all. I may just stick to the burbs.... Thanks for the reply.
"I‚Äôm glad you fixed Minnesota, because there is a 0% chance we will go Red."
"This is simply honesty + humility. Indeed, very respectable."

"That's the idea, don't be so indignant that I called out your bs."
oliver and black canary is evergreen.. [NAME] is the most annoying character since season 3.. why would CW come up with that
"Oh, but amazingly it seemed to work out in the end because oil eating bacteria evolved in the Gulf of Mexico"
It always makes me super happy when I see stuff like this. Go live your best life girl!
Yayyyy [NAME]!!!! Now go get a hat trick tonight!
"Your mindset is the right mindset, sadly, it's easier said than done."
I'm hoping that the TTK might help. He's really bad at R6 for the most part.
Happy new years!!!!

"Thank you. I've been correcting the record for triggered authoritarians for a minute! ""Mah taxes"""
I think I should say that I am a student and have no income.
"Her playing with fire, and getting burned. Stay strong. "
Probably fake. In most situations Siri will tend to avoid words like penis and hope you're saying pianist
"Good for him, most guys are like [NAME] and would take her back in an instant."
Hope you're ok!
I will third Blues City Deli...the Prez [NAME] is ridiculous!
"Salaam, these thoughts happen. It is the shaitan trying to divert you from the path. May [NAME] grant you patience and the steadfastness to protect yourself."

[NAME] plays well in Texas. So there is that.
Yo good for you!

Honestly rams are my second NFC team. I wanted you to win it all since the beginning of the playoffs and I love the team even more now
"Oh man, glad I'm not watching this with my extremely emetophobic mother "
You are a treasure. Please know how wonderful you are. Big hugs to you.
Ok. Thanks
"Ha! I actually included that on purpose, was poking fun at me (and the typical MS3) :)"
"Now I remember, you're an OC student. This sub tells me you're brilliant..."
Youre being dowmvoted but you are absolutely correct. I have a feelingnyour downvotes are more a sign of the obesity problem than anything
I like that [NAME] is still [NAME]
This is legit an awesome idea. There‚Äôs a reason rifles are shouldered like that. Makes it easier to stabilize it. Stability is important in photography
It was so great to have a nice friendly NPC like that. Just one student that didn't hate our guts.
Almost the same Win% as [NAME]. Nice.
"<3 It was hilarious, sorry I doubted you!"
That's just reckless. He's lucky he didn't get permanently disfigured or killed.
You get a lot more freedom and free time. College is a blast
Thank you :)
Good Luck at the SuperBowl [NAME]!
It's literally not. I love that people believe it. I'd like to see any info showcasing it.
"C1,2 7.30 pm [NAME] to [NAME], ""I how how you can throw down"" HAHAHA!!! "
Did you have to make this picture yourself because it‚Äôs just wonderful
I just hope the show brings [NAME] back because she was really great.
"Peace and love, my brother!"
"Hahaha, good point"
Just try really hard to not ghost her and give her some kind of closure. Ghosting will most likely hurt more... Good luck.
"Come on, this would be funny with a better caption."
Italy would be so awesome - I think it's one of those countries you'll just instantly fall in love with.
Thanks a lot
Yes they do. Thank you for the idea!
Alright thanks to all. I will tr it with more wards the next time and boots and penetration. Thx for your support!
Yo your eyes are glued wide open like aderal and you move your head all the way back you are done
Will be when we organise a run on the banks and hopefully take the only thing Westminster cares about away from them.
"Thanks, now I can get back to the actual content"
Ah thank you! I just remembered it the way I said. Was never sure if that's what it meant.
I love lamp.
I'm glad people with such foresight are the first to find this place unaffordable. Good riddance.
Nice job continuing to ignore the fact she lost her home and her father at the peak of the 2008 housing crisis you obtuse prick
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs also cute‚Äù I say as I look at the 5k in LEGO I‚Äôm hoarding
Welcome to our world.
Sorry. Was hard to understand for me as well.
Stop trying and just do it. Then decide if it‚Äôs worth the effort. Otherwise this is just envy.
I‚Äôve had the impossible burger. I was actually amazed. Thorough review here looking forward to trying the beyond burger
No one in particular....i mean to people who believe that [NAME] and [NAME] are actually in love.
I love the way they make my skin feels after I use them. I also use the primer for my makeup.
Word. I have 0 of these in my life. I miss my INTJ ex brother-in-law haha.
nearly 9 minutes?! no wonder you're getting downvoted lol

Just woke up and bull run already started.. loving the üí© show
"Damn straight. It‚Äôs a new year, and our troubles are just opportunities for future success!"
"Now it's a double birth stone, so it's extra special!"
I feel you. Most look generic af. I've seen some absolutely stunning ones though. Like [NAME]. She's a 10/10 IMO.
"No, I definitely understand that feel and empathize. That can be hard to deal with. How have you been as of late?"
Don‚Äôt be silly. Fiat on/off ramps will always be centralized.
This thought brings me too much joy. The tantrum-throwing traitor has taken me to a very dark place.
Thank you so much! This summarizes a lot!
You‚Äôll love r/2healthbars
Really appreciate this post and article. I just subscribed and between this and the sidebar I'm feeling pumped about starting he learning.

"Glad I could help. (Side tip: hit return twice to break out of the "">>"")"
[NAME] looked so lost for 3 quarters. No pocket awareness. Terribly inaccurate. I hope this version of [NAME] is here to stay.
I‚Äôm convinced WB is more of a pain than it‚Äôs worth. Good luck making adjustments during the semester. I feel your pain.
I agree I think they hyped it up
Now that's what I call projection!
"Hilarious video, thank you for making us smile :)"
Yes - sometimes I see amazingly detailed little faces. It's so weird.
"Where's my thank you for that flair, hm? This is theft."
"As long as I have my plasma rifle and some combat armour, I think I can traverse the wastes without a ride just fine. "
This seems like a very good write-up to me. I've been debating the issue a lot recently and haven't really come to a definite conclusion.
We all lose it too fast from time to time...but you have to make up for it. Hope it gets better.
Thanks for yelling it
Thanks i hate it.
"Cheers, [NAME]!"
Well... this should get interesting.
I love Fish Stick

sorry you have to deal with things like that. i hope things are better where you are now
Until we win an actual SuperBowl trophy I want all the positive karma.

You're right but ‚Äùjust be confident‚Äù (I know that you didn't say it ) is really hard when you're unattractive

I wish I could make a garden
[NAME] looks like [NAME] gorgeous

"I'm excited for them, but I can understand why anyone wouldn't be. They both use the fighting styles of characters who are already in the game"

If your dog is an arctic breed they will go crazy with joy and be sad that you don‚Äôt share in their happiness for the bitter cold.

"Don't see it at all, but she's cute with the freckles"
It is not selfish to end a relationship that is causing you great stress and you feel is over despite loving them.
Same can be said for fragile liberals who can't handle cultural traditions and keep trying to push the envelope.
Bless them!

And then expanded on! It's so good. Haha I still remember hours and hours spent on Friends of Mineral Town though...
Great album! üëä

"i was in that thread, but i can at least admit it ;)"
I haven‚Äôt seen this format before. And I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs original. But I like it.

I think they're doing it so they can ignore the fact that [NAME] served [NAME] to champions at the White House lol

Hell's Kitchen. I bet that man could make [NAME] cry.
Lucky bastard the cool change came 5 minutes into the wedding
"I love how he misses that last punch when he goes down lol. Like, thats when the liver shot really sunk in"
He seems sweet and I think he really loves her.

It was a good sub before the porn took over
Ya know... a helmet never hurt anyone
Thank you. Give her and your other doggie extra kisses for me. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Seriously doubt it will be Knights of Ren, but that would certainly be a great way to get people excited and build hype."
Funny I‚Äôm on my second play through and this happens...
Let's be fair to them and say not forever. But at least until I die.
I think this is a normal human emotion that a lot of people can relate to.
"Thank you for the vote of confidence, but this experience has really effected me"
I'm not counting on them getting elected. I'm counting on them putting enough pressure on the Conservatives to actually become at least a little conservative.
"Yes, I remember when I said that. Thanks for the reminder! "
I cried reading your last posts. I‚Äôm so sorry about what happened. I hope you are able to make a change in their system.

Oh so now we‚Äôre not letting plays finish before calling offside cool..
That was an old-fashioned Good old hockey brawl! What a fight! [NAME] definitely got the best of him though!

I find it funny the same people obsessed with ‚Äúowning the libs‚Äù call others ‚Äúintellectually bankrupt‚Äù
That's ma'am!
Sounds like you might need some time out in the re-education camp. You are getting frighteningly close to realizing that our system is designed to keep you imprisoned.
"Thanks for that, I just turned 35 and considering nursing and starting over too"
Absolutely you are doing the right thing. She will not take this decision lightly. So be prepared for the fallout now.
"Can't blame him. As an [NAME], everything I know about American Football came from Eyeshield 21."

"Thank you, I will def look that up. "
We sincerely hope not.
Finally some appreciation
He's likeable but the pace of a game on live tv is too much for him. He'd definitely be better suited as a halftime guy

I think those red hats increase their IQ by -1
Happy Birthday [NAME]!
I'd be happy with a Goff win too. And you can't hate Brees. Rams vs. Chargers would be perfect. final score 72-70.

You‚Äôre truly welcome :)

[NAME] was pretty cool on The Challenge so I would love to see him on CBB.
lol instead of getting blocked he deleted his account and called us all soulless and depraved.
"she said (i swear to [NAME]) her doctors told her she wasnt bipolar and has ""anxiety caused by other people"" "
What did we do to deserve [NAME]? Loved that guy since his buff days
the excitement when they all first come in always makes me happy

Yep! It's still busy. Slightly less crowded but still fun!
Yayyy!!! Go little green bean go!!! Good job trainer!!
It isn't complicated at all. You are growing up. Congrats.
Probably just do the job and try to work out your anxiety rather than taking the path of least resistance which offers no character growth. Best of luck
But the seriousness makes it funnier. YES HELLO 311? SOMEONE IS WRONG ON THE INTERNET.
"Can confirm, I have 2 (but be careful as you may still be allergic to their saliva)"

"Hey [NAME], just wanted to say thanks for coming to Minnesota, that‚Äôs all :) "
And then the oligarchs in charge will be forced to say how they really feel about America... this bizarre logic has very interesting potential.
Good thing I don't watch porn lol
Wow. That'll teach you to try and help!
"Haha, I feel that"
This is awesome. What did they play?
[NAME] has shot the three well the past few games. great to see

I guess 14 years of customer service experience is good for something after all.
The restaurant business is pretty sleazy. There are a lot of affairs there.
I guess that's better. I think an important aspect of feminism is that it allows idealized women to be imperfect yet exemplary nevertheless.
That looks like some pretty intense ‚Äúhomework‚Äù
Memes are going to get fucking fantastic though
I wish [NAME] was fit enough to be fourth choice.
"nice try, [NAME]"
I second that. A broader mobilization and awareness would go a long way.

I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs soup chef.

"Perfect, thank you!! [NAME] this week and [NAME] next week, I‚Äôm getting closer and closer to having them all!! :)"
Sounds like you're in a good place. I'm happy for you. For me... Right now I don't care how my STBXH is doing. Hahaha.

I'd love to see [NAME] in a 4-3 to be honest.
"Wow! Thanks! We‚Äôre working on it! Glad you liked it (this is [NAME], the [NAME] one)... appreciate your support!"
At least [NAME] gave us entertainment

Thanks for the summary. I was having a hard time keeping up! :)
Thanks so much!!!
"Ok maybe I misunderstood your argument, so your just sayin that state's still have significant ""autonomous"" power? Because I agree with that."
I guess the answer is pretty obvious too lol. It would be silly if you posted ‚Äú[NAME] too...‚Äù the bucs?
If you've ever heard him speak on almost anything he's clearly extremely intelligent even if he's being crass.
Better try next time. Remember to apply yourself and learn history instead of getting angry.

"Skeptical approach, always lol"
I think its hilarious that you can't seem to understand the joke of the headline.
"Thanks, didn't know that"
This is one of the most entertaining posts I've seen in a long time. Got a little adrenaline surge when he jumped. Wow.
Funny they put her between [NAME] and [NAME] as well.
Pretty cool that the same building is there just a different use.

"Ohhh, thank you for enlightening me üòÇüòÇ"
That one is much better.. you win :(

As much as I like [NAME] and want him to score so many (hes a speedy mofo) I think that this would be a good trade for sure
He is probably taking it slow to change thinks. I just hope that he is not an actual fan of [NAME] system. That would be a disaster

My girlfriend and I watch it all the time and love making love while it‚Äôs playing in the background!

This is a beautiful reply with advice that is spot on.
"I've been in China for years. I love it. Great job, apartment and love my city. I've never had a single problem "

Roses - still gives me goosebumps till this day

I cringe every time [NAME] is in a fast break because it usually ends with his shot getting spiked lol.
"Yay, another second tier free agent over 30. Thank God we're making a market for these players. Go Mets!"

Love how he stops and embraces the pole.

I love it. Enjoy your upvote.
"Agreed, those who are waiting for their life-changing amounts to buy a home for their families just have to wait.. they are so selfish"
I'm glad you could relate and that you also found some peace and resolution in your relationship. I'm glad we didn't give up!
Love that we have the same amount of playoff wins as them this year!

Yes please. What's that @ ?
I‚Äôm just glad that the academy is FINALLY progressive enough to nominate a mediocre [NAME] biopic directed by a pedophile.
Hot damn... we're going to Sea World!
I found her advice very insightful. Maybe it will be of use to
Really liked your law and dragon ones man. Good stuff.

Glad to see you guys are treating him well

Thanks for the feedback!
[NAME] this is pretty funny bit of info he just revealed I guess he showed up and they were like yeah u got final say deal with it
Kabhi Khushi kabhi gam? Slightly different but raichands were rich and mother was doing pooja.
Aquaria looks great but her eyebrows look like gummy worms lmao
Wow thank you so much for explaining all that to me! It sounds like you guys have a great system going on - very organized.
You didn't like the joke? I thought it was an instant classic.
Thank you for mentioning that!

That is some serious dedication... He must love his job
thanks <3 *hugs*
"I will admit,I did chuckle a bit"
"Old school runescape, make an Ironman. It changes the game and makes everything so much more meaningful and fun :) hardcore if you enjoy stress"
At least it made for hilarious responses by people being aghast by the price.
Hope you feel the same way when his rookie deal is up
I'm so happy for you !
I hope [NAME] makes a full recovery.
Same here. I kept listening to the damn puns.
"Great, petty revenge instead of making your GF happy by removing [NAME] from her life, nice job!"
He‚Äôs just awesome. It‚Äôs refreshing in a celebrity
Hope he takes a break before managing again... I love the guy but he needs to update/reevaluate some of his tactics and methods
love this!
Ducks just happy. Hadn‚Äôt had a shit for days

Makes it even better that a multi millionaire successful pro athlete is shitting on him [NAME] damn I love me some sweet twitter roasting
Can‚Äôt wait to lose this one!
I wish I could hear Waves with earbuds/headphones for the first time again
Sounds like a great idea that your nephew is moving away from her. She‚Äôd be an absolutely toxic mother.
So? [NAME] was and is a far higher rated player than [NAME] as much as I like him.
"""Sponge Blurb Pubs Quaw Haha GURR ha AAa!"" finale is too real"
You're welcome! Glad you're enjoying them.
Can't wait to move out of the city so I can get a gun. No gun city living sucks
[NAME] is the prettiest person on This Show
"I would love a lineup of [NAME], [NAME] he can play [NAME]), and [NAME]."

This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

I want the same drug OP is into thanks!
Nice hiss!
"I really hope we see another fighter like him he was so fun to watch, a fighting machine with that killer instinct"
Whoa I'm impressed he returned the pillow to its original spot. Awesome parenting.
If this is the original Thai (I think) one then I would say it was a pretty good watch. Haven‚Äôt watched any other versions
Gotta love [NAME].
> I was more making fun of your spelling of Northbridg whoops
I come to this sub to see cool things lol. For me it's a better version of /r/pics
Yes my mother is ok with it.
He only said that to piss [NAME] off because he wanted her to kill him and put him out of his misery. He‚Äôs a good guy.
Gets right back on his phone call. I like it. Must‚Äôve been one important booty call.
"What a catch, that's how you win championship games there. Wow."
I take care of my kids!
Thank you kind stranger. You might have just made my eyes mist a little.
"This is true, but he's perceived as white by most liberals. "
There is always the risk of a team throwing him a stupid offer sheet. I still wish we would've thrown a max at [NAME].
Good tips!
Resting up after a furious weekend of #MAGAboys hate. A xer has needs for xedz beauty rest
As long as [NAME] isn't suggesting [NAME] to the Lakers I'm ok with pretty much any Ringer rumor
"I know. And it's very selfish of me to say, but I just wish it was different people that cared."
"this is epic satire, too bad its close to much of what the right unironically believes"
Haha! I love it. That‚Äôs exactly how it would go.
I wish I could believe in myself
"Haha yeah, apparently their ringleader just got banned on Twitter. "
Let's hope he doesn't change his mind.
"According to them, it's perfectly acceptable to have intimacy with a woman and then ghost/block her number. Lol."
"100% agreed. If wanting people to understand the meaning of my comment makes me a coward, then I don't wanna be fucking brave."
"Ha ha you're being down voted. Edit: Hey, you're being up voted! Congrats!"
"Oops, just kidding [NAME], got you."
"Aww, look at you still wearing your hospital bracelets even. "
The only excuse for folding there pre is timing out. Ever. (I really hope that's what happened)
No I actually really like that I don‚Äôt have to pump my own gas.
This is the correct answer. I've seen more stupid memes about this show before I'd even seen it.
Keep trying! :) I‚Äôve just had a look and enjoyed the ones of yours I read.
"Hey fellow conservative, you seem concerned. "
"You're a good man, [NAME]"
She might be hungry too since she didn‚Äôt lose her head ... feed that skinny thang
The only thing better than winning for a Vikings fan is reveling in the losses of our enemies.
thank [NAME] it was returned
It looks like Marvin the Martian's ship. I'm still geeked as hell though. Also glad they provided a space suit for scale.
THAT DOES IT!
"I find it hard to say ""no"" to anyone, but I knew if I didn't, he would have done exactly what you said. "

I just got got and I like it
"Unfortunately later died from eating tainted meat. [NAME] BBC documentary 'dynasties' followed the marsh pride, the lion episode was awesome"
Guessing the bra sizes of anime characters after having stared at them for so long... That's... an interesting hobby.
"love that, we need more women like you "
if the game would stop crashing on my ps4 that would be great :c
"Yes, you said you are dying, I cannot do anything about that, hope you find peace"
^^ a better idea
There‚Äôs something I love about the idea of eating a cheap meal on fancy tableware
Always look before you jump.
Funny how picture comes with no article link... typical BS post..
Thanks so much for this pic! It‚Äôs even funnier the third time in ten minutes it‚Äôs posted here.

Our majestic space ship!
"This is alright, but [NAME] deserves a higher rating"
Wise words :) she is quite remarkable in so many ways. I guess that I will just see or won't see :D
Hugs hugs hugs. So many big hugs and good vibes. That's the only thing I know how to say right now.
Thank you for the kind words :)
"When you feel nervousness, tell yourself it's just excitement. Makes a world of difference. :)"
"Excellent idea, thank you!"
I understand completely. People have no memory or understanding of the true horror of these diseases. I am truly glad you have decided to vaccinate. Blessings [NAME]
Don‚Äôt worry about the baby but yes worry about your mom...
"Oh, haha Gladstone is a town in North Qld Australia as well... thanks Reddit"
Happy Birthday!
agree with the messaging but such a cringe video
"I'm most excited, honestly, for the new batches of eastern coral antivenom."
"Except... that's exactly what I was taught in [RELIGION] school. One god, theee aspects."
Thank you for this
Thank you for sharing your beautiful and continuing story. It's comforting to see growth and deep love in relationships. I wish you both the best!
I love this sub reddit üòçüòÇ
You shouldn't skip to any scene. This is a masterpiece from start to finish.
Interesting. I‚Äôm not a troll.But if it makes you feel better...
Wow! That sounds like an interesting dream! Thank you for your perspective.
Thanks for this. I was about to relapse but am still going strong.
"We‚Äôve done this twice, we have four awesome trees from them. Awesome organization!"
They didn‚Äôt take it; you abandoned it. A TSA agent clarified that for me once. I hope you can replace it easily.
Part of being an adult is putting awkward on the back burner because some things are more important and need to be said.
Then you should probably get out more.
Oh cool it‚Äôs another episode where lefties forget about consent
In that case... Happy Amnesia Day!
"I'm 58, my 40 year wife is 59, and my handfasted wife is 64. I'm so in love with both of them!"
I'm happy to hear all that.
Clearly there is only one way to solve this dilemma; COMMUNISM!
I hope having family in high places will help me gain opportunities to liberate others.
Agree with most of above apart from TERA is no cash grab unlees you just want to fast forward a little with gear and it really is a little lol
Yeah I switched to maining NM in 6 as well and it was the exact wrong game to do that lol
We're in it... and now [NAME] is going to the bench? Gotta good feeling!
This is a genuinely good point. It‚Äôs enough to take me from giving zero shits to giving a modest shit against them.
Recently swapped my sanwa out back for a hori with a heavy spring . it feels really good
I love the 90s for all the same reasons. It was so comfy and effortless! And yes!!! All evidence can remain hidden!!!
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** rebel_alliance05! ^(hug)
The fried baloney is amazing.
Wife of a lawyer. This is correct
Yes - thanks for this. Have just finally contacted a counsellor after talking about it for years.
Will add to Plano's directory when I make it. Thanks!
[NAME] has been playing pretty nice since he's been freed from dnps
oh thank you! im relatively new-ish and did not know that
I am so excited for tonight's episode! It's barely even started *_*
"Lol, some guntards stepped out of the echo chamber and sounded completely unhinged."
"I like Sao very much, bit not because of the game setting, for other reasons. The game itself sucks, tbh."
It's alright. This is just an unpleasant memory now. Kind of rude of your brother though!
Bless your dog!
"The movie with crispy Lord [NAME]. ""Good Evening, [NAME]."""
"Love him! ""Thank You God"" is one of my favorites of his."
"Fantastic read, thanks for the insights! "
I can safely and honestly attest that I have had *nothing* to do with any disappearances of any sort. ~~[NAME] has already touched the reply button.~~
The kidd series is by far my favorite. Much more lighthearted than the prey books.
Hahaha how old are your sons? They're mixin' batches with your body wash hahaha
Too cute for me. Why cant i have a boyfriend *[NAME]*
It took me a moment but it was unexpected and got a laugh
I never pre-order anything and I am never disappointed with that decision
I wish your mom had used the stick on his mom and explained that she has to be allowed to do it because otherwise she'd cry.
THANK YOU [NAME]
Very true. Having a 3rd pair of [NAME] and [NAME] has been solid
its becoming increasingly concerning that you refer to yourself in the plural.
"Make the fro bigger, and it will be a perfect master piece. Rating 9.9 out of 10"
That looks so awesome
While you were listening to [NAME] he was idolizing [NAME].
Thats true. Those kinds of drinks can give you a heart attack.
I hope this doesn't means we won't get to see [NAME] as playable god.
Yay! Smug buddies!
i love his face for that split second after he is hit
Da‚Äôts a beauty. Got sniped at auction with seconds left to lose [NAME] from this summer.
Oh whoops haha
"Love the flower, and hope you feel better!"
"You should probably use that time to make a decent argument not the other thread then, I'm just going to leave you here ."
6% of [NAME] is [NAME] so it wouldn't be a shock if he was of this community.
"Don't even bother with him lol. He's a mindless sexist, doesn't believe facts at all lmao"
"Oh jeez, just took back my upvote I gave this photo. Thanks for telling us, that's extremely messed up"
I‚Äôve missed my sweet prince
My favorite!
"He's not an ugly guy, but 8 is too high. He's between 5-6."
Far from it. Name me one player that's ever left NY that we wanted to retain. I'll wait.
She seems like the quality girl I'd like to marry and introduce to my parents
I‚Äôm laughing so I don‚Äôt cry
Satire satire satire satire Please O lod almight plez be satire

This is great!
Female INTP and i concur! Especially the kids bit! And the Adorkable!
The weapon wasn‚Äôt made until 1918-1919 so hopefully this will never be real
For real! So happy they just put season 2 on hulu
We love you!!!!! And we would love if you still made them
The whole thing is poetry. That finish is magic. Nose to the mit. Love this !
I hope there's a 3rd jump ball.
I used this one just last night. Worked like a charm
100% yes. My sister's ex is an actual monster but my niece still sees his family.
"Lol, that slomo"
Keep up the good work
Well thanks. Digital currency is one thing I personally havent gotten into yet.
"Love this, and the comments are great, thanks for sharing."
"Opposite for us! My fiance cuddles me because it helps him fall asleep, then I can play video games in bed!"
Who specifically are we gonna sue? The industry! Lol
Guns go off accidentally all the time. Don‚Äôt point them at someone unless you plan to kill them.
Im almost done with season 7 now. This show ans the office were probably my two all time favorite shows.
"That's interesting, considering that the other area is Mt. Tremblant, which is a real area of Qu√®bec."

Thank you so much for sharing this... really opened my mind.
This interview has so much gold in it. The Wreck it Ralph bit is my favourite.
"[NAME] would be an exciting guy to bring here. I think he'd at some help at RB, especially if [NAME] ain't interested"
Time for a courageous conversation!
[NAME] at least has a pretty face and great skin. [NAME] looks like a cabbage patch kid.
The design was interesting. But it had a lot of flaws
I‚Äôm a millennial and my mortgage payment only takes about 1/5 of my after tax earnings in a month. Feels so good.
I never said anything about a crowded city. Immigration is not causing rural (or even suburban) areas to turn into crowded cities.
Pharmacy residencies started that in 2017 and honestly it makes the process so much better for both candidates and applicants.
Your parents must have adopted.
"I wish, have to wait 3 weeks"
I still love Asian women. They will always be number 1 for me (exlcuding [NAME] of course)
Like whoever you want to like but don‚Äôt treat people poorly based on superficial factors is ultimately the best advice
Hahahahaha I love this idea. I‚Äôm totally doing this!
"haha they definitely test for patience... looking at you gov.uk, and the whole of hmrc if I'm honest."
"ha, hardly. maybe the biggest city. Russia is fucking huge."
I could see that nobody wants to be called ignorant. I also learned about the fallacy from [NAME].
I love it when drama comes home to roost
Fair enough. Thanks for the input.
I may be mistaken but I believe it‚Äôs illegal to fly over the north and south poles for any aviator
> The makeup is very technically sound You have a point. I can hear it from here.
I'm going to blow your fucking mind. I dip my Hawaiian pizza in ranch. Booooooooom.
Damn I've only seen kittens snuggle like that that's adorable
Lmao that‚Äôs actually pretty good.
Just gonna say it. Bahahahahahaha
I wish they let him do the quatrains once a week during the NFL season.
happy cake day.
"I rate [NAME] highly, so this is good news."
"Agreed, probs an older brother. Source: am an older brother"
Haha...what kind of fan base would do that?
Shaming. Lol
Jokes on you. I have anxiety so I do this a lot
It was an honor just to be nominated. Being a runner-up is a dream come true ( I keep my dreams realistic and attainable).
She has an amazing voice
ITS A GOOD BOI!!
Eh. I say it's accurate.
I wanted to romance [NAME] more than I've wanted to romance more than any other character in the series. Such an awesome dude
"Great talent, this. No ysts reaction, but I still appreciate it."
He was a good dude.
"I use to play with colored pencils as a child, I also use to play with chapsticks and lipsticks too! They are very entertaining!"
What a sweetheart.
That's a better love story than Twilight!
"Fair, although you'll get caught pretty easily like that"
Banks! I knew it!
Slovenia is awake and ready for some Mavs magic!
I actually enjoy doing this on my own. Am I weird?
Your actions mean your gf is still being bullied. Nice move
[NAME] bless [NAME]!
That rain bit was hilarious.
Increase in robberies on pot shops. I really hope not though.
What a greedy person. 8 years jail and hopefully disgraced out of his profession.
Prayers for Dipo you guys. Just had a gruesome injury
I wish to die with my will and spirit intact!
Hard agree it‚Äôs sooo creepy. I hope she‚Äôs ok that man had serial killer written all over him.
Awesome footage. The one child signing to look into his eyes looks as though he is jaundiced. His eyes are quite green yellow colour.
O.o love it üëå
I suggest going to the food carts. Buy some legal weed. Enjoy the bars. Go to Washington Park.
Thanks all. It was a league game in our local bar. The dealer rotates on each hand. Lesson learned from me.
"Good point, I never thought about that. I guess I don't see enough commercials regularly to separate them from just other company agenda videos. Thanks!"
Nah u mad lol
I would love to hang out with him & listen to his stories
[NAME] is having a visible affect on his game and I love it. I think we are witnessing the development of a future star.
"162 Again, for the 7th straight year. Like usual lol"
I‚Äôm proud of you and I‚Äôm happy for you!
True. But that is one out of many.
Turgeon offense at it's finest. The ball never gets past the three point line and [NAME] just hits a three in someone's face.
Ayyy! Thanks for finishing it up. Glad someone did. LOL @ your username üòÇüòÇ
Good luck! The life ahead of you holds 1000% more promise than the one you are leaving behind. They caused this ... not you.
Fair enough haha
Yeah I meant it has a cork in it. Sorry for the confusion haha
Ok thank you
[NAME] ruined religion. It‚Äôs the only good thing they‚Äôve done.
Hell yes!
I wish I could come up with a bad cat joke in response to that.
"I just want to note that ""Live Photo"" is something how I'd expect [NAME] describe a video."
I was about to lose my shit but then I finally found the Plumbus
"I know the feeling, but you‚Äôre not disgusting. Happy new year!"
I always hope that a woman will ask me out...next time it happens will be the first.
Wish you the best of luck and greener pastures!
"Lol valid question, but yes. We've been using the bf and gf terminology for about 5 months."
So excited!! Probably gonna be my new main ‚öîÔ∏èüõ°
Oh! That explains why your teeth look like they‚Äôre covered by something haha
"That's a pretty cat. It would be nice if it could go to Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue, as they are no-kill."
"That explains it, I rarely report people anymore This Khajit informs the other Khajit that it is welcome"
Would love to share this on twitt and FB ...
[NAME] had a great idea about this problem actually
He wasn‚Äôt just a good boye He was the bestest
JACKPOT!!!
Big thanks to OP for that magnificent wall. I guess that we can reopen the government now.
"I love when that happens. I call it ""butt cuddles"" and we do it all the time lol!"
its pretty wholesome tho
Lol you got us there hahahahahaha way cheaper too
Your wife is very lucky to have you. I hope my WS feels like this one day. I pray for it every night.

I'm sure the guy i lease my space from will love it when I ask to transfer some BAT to cover next month's rent.
HA! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! That‚Äôs amazing. Thanks for starting my morning off with a good laugh. What a couple of idiots.
It isn‚Äôt that bad :/
See this guy gets it!
There was nothing innovating lol. It was good but chill
I love this. Hopefully it is more successful than [NAME] (RIP).
Great job! Hats off to you.
Must not have been the [NAME] of his day... But seriously though i hope he's alright..
"Ah, didn‚Äôt know that but can‚Äôt blame him. Thanks!"
"If they rig the DNC once, they can do it again."
Wow that‚Äôs actually a great idea lmao
[NAME] looked great!
Rule number 1: never dye your hair while drunk haha
It's unrelated to the post yet I'm laughing out loud
The Citadel has given us much to be thankful for.
[NAME] is such a pretty lady. I'm jealous of those huge eyes!
This is really great!!
I love rational comments.
"Lol! Too funny. Mine are depressed, they gave up. :("
Oh nice!
There are too many depressing headlines on the news. This story made me laugh.
Nicely framed.
"That's so sweet, you have good friends. How old did you turn that birthday?"
We were playing bots for 30 mins... Not fun but i am happy i finally did it
He already has 2 fouls
"will do, thanks"
Love this!!!
I believe if he did (and she didn‚Äôt) then he SHOULD be in even more trouble. They can easily fact check that.
I like that that guy didn't make a snarky remark in 2015 because he was upset that another MP was sitting in his usual seat.
"Need some new prog material, I'm stoked to listen to it!"
My faith in humanity is restored. Your good deed has been noted on the Big Board of Doing Nice Things.
The famous tank man. We know close to nothing about him. So I rather preferred to think he is living his life peacefully.
"They had been chanting ""we want tacos!"" Lol"

[NAME] is legit! Loving this move.
"Such a hilarious way to put it, and omg yup."
I wish I loved anything the way [NAME] loves playing hockey

I like how his actual clone comes running up to him to congratulate him on that recovery
Love the whole lebatard community but she has the most confidence speaking and it shows up on all the shows she does
As a fellow shuffle/jamskater this makes me really happy lol.

Cheers!!
My tongue is still a little scorched lol. But totally worth it
This honestly explains so much. Thanks for some insight into myself lol
wow i watch the video fews time and I'm still amazed
What are the sequels called? Loved Infernal Affairs
It more effective if you do it in person
You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
Thank you! I‚Äôll give it a listen tonightüòä

No more like he took away their talking point about paying federal workers. Lol salty downvote
Thank you that‚Äôs sweet of you (:

I think we'll find out how apt this comparison is within the next few years.
Yep. First Monday of 2019.

I used to know a woman who got a lot of freelance work out of okcupid. Never done it myself though.
"Ending the quarter with some point [NAME] action, I love it "
Yep. There are some good things hidden in amongst the bad. It would be disingenuous to claim otherwise.

If I'm not mistaken we will have [NAME] as backup next year so not bad at all.

"some state are way more paranoid about this than others. also depend who handle the call / judge... like, some people believe spanking should be criminal..."
So we can forgive her a little for burdening Dunder Mifflin üòÇ
With the way [NAME] has been playing I‚Äôm just hoping it‚Äôs not a coincidence that [NAME] is playing well too.

This picture is as old as Tinder. OP is probably a dog for all we know.
"yea I agree, and [NAME] is way younger so has trade value. [NAME] is still an offensive powerhouse but his DWAR is slumping."
The sex must be great.
Also very funny that communists can still expect it to end up in a different end-game. Well not funny though. :
Currently waiting for the inevitable gopher collapse into the tight finish I know and love.
Glad they made it..
I like picking beans with grandma.

Ok... if you think its time.... have a fun safe trip
Yeah no problem. Sorry about that.
"NSFW tagged for showing [NAME]. But anyways, I hope you enjoy the video!"

I‚Äôm interested!
"Thank you, this isn't the first time they have tried to control us with money. They always put odd stipulations on money or gifts."
This is a family friendly sub; please don't say the McC-word.
Thank you for commenting exactly what I was going to comment and saving me the trouble!
I‚Äôm actually feeling these commercials. Especially the young dancer dude haha. This is how you advertise to your demographic!
Thank you for educating me. Lol
Your description fits the type of SB I prefer. I don't see short hair as a negative.
The majority is not relevant: it was advisory. I agree a second vote is needed to kill the [NAME] trope.

Spiritual shorthand. You nailed it. That term says it all. They've become so practiced in it that it has become meaningless.
You might be right. Not everybody is going to find their way the same as I did.
"They do get an awful lot of upvotes, so they seem to have at least some support from others."

Beautiful view!
TYM is the best place for that kind of thing.
Kids in Africa could have eaten those cigarettes.. :( Kidding. Good for you man. Congrats!
Fast as [NAME] will carry me. Seriously uptown to downtown via Claiborne or broad isn‚Äôt that bad

I'm really concerned for those 3200'ish people who voted yes
[NAME] is my favorite qb prospect and I've been watching football for 11 years
I like the game tonight
"slander? it's only slander if it's untrue, and all I said was that you don't grasp satire, which is obviously true."
Haha i love chinese food
Yup. Soft serve turd special
Second this. You can cycle along Maribyrnong river for most of it which is pretty relaxing. Fast and healthy too.
You might want to let your attorney know about this encounter. I wish I could send you some teabags and a hug.
"Yes, In the edit, after I already made my comment. "
I laughed at this
Her bi energy is so strong tbh
I think I like em even more lol
Thank you for sharing!
"Its interesting how it's become so mythologised and based on a large mount of fiction (tanks on the streets, English soldiers) "

Well then just ice it (if you haven‚Äôt already) and hope for the best

Dude I love working OC. You can bounce around like 4 different districts
You win some you lose some. Still love my mavs.
I really liked [NAME] tbh
This is awesome. You can really see how little wasted motion [NAME] had‚Äîeverything looked effortless.
Agree but 2015/2016 KAT != 2018 KAT
I wish I could upvote this a million times. What a wonderful tack to take.
[NAME] was our only playmaker the past few years.
Happy cake day Mr bot
Great game Pens!

I‚Äôm single I‚Äôve had it thrown at me But I‚Äôm being more choosey about who I spend my bed with this year
Something I just thought of... Can you email her or text her instead of call? I find it's easier to deal with difficult people that way.
Don't worry... I'm on this. I'm using the non business days to cool off and figure it out. Visiting an attorney Monday morning.
Nice try OSI
HAHHAHA thats good
but it sure looks good

The best part about reading brietbart articles is you know they won't give any facts to support their statement.
I do go to the school counselor once a week. Thank you for the suggestions
This is the kind of thing that makes me want to low key record every single one of my lyft/uber rides.
Jeez this would be such a turn off to try and help people in the future
he's interested. maybe text him explaining what you're telling us just more concise
"Ok, if that's what you think. I'm just a bystander at this point and laughing at how angry people are getting."
My pleasure. It pays the bills.

"""I love games. That's why I keep all those zip ties, plastic sheeting, balls gags and cattle prodders in my trunk."""
HAHAHA YES MEYERS
That would be the greatest night ever!
"Yes, it's great! What I really love watching them play school on the playground."
Damnit. Have a big trip planned for the first week of February. Can't wait to get to the airport 5 hours early.
Let's hope she will never work as a medical professional again.
"Hell yeah, high five. Good job!"
I would choose to go in the coolest way possible. Don‚Äôt know what that would be but I would want my last moments to be memorable.
Read. Smoke weed. Video games. Smoke weed and CLEAN ALL THE THINGS!
"I agree with that, that's really the only reason I play pk too. Probably the reason my win rate for her is 40%"
[NAME]!! Awesome!! He's the only one that i have anything signed by
Homing pigeons make the best SOs
Thank you for reminding me!
"Agree, she needs to learn to value herself. "
Yeah I think most of what [NAME] says is sensible policy but this would be a step too far.
I like these kinds of multicultural projects. Very much in line with my feels about South Africa.
i accidentally liked one where my ex was underage....
Blue Cheese is about as close as my lips and tongue are going to come to pronouncing that. lol
"Very true, honestly. Hopefully one day indiginous issues won't be a political career killer, and we'll have a PM that dares to do something."

Volunteer. Helping people in need will make you feel better about both yourself and others.
This looks amazing. I'm sure Netflix will cancel the series in February.
It‚Äôs beautiful
This is your first boyfriend so you're overanalyzing more than you normally would. It's your issue you just have to move past it.
"Got it! I wasn't aware that it was a slur, and thought that it was just a general term used. Thanks for the info."
I love that [NAME] knows to have both hands visible in the photo with that young girl. Better safe than sorry.
Gotta love Texas high school football for exposing me early.
Ah I love when I‚Äôm looking at a random thread and find you in the comments. Hey [NAME]!
"Damn, you just reminded me how good that feels..."
I would say love is never enough. Love is unconditional. Relationships are not.
You may be onto something. Strange that I agree with this now.
Better still get the free game!
Inspiring music that makes you proud.
"I love the lady in the green jacket chasing after the second car looking back at the first car like ""look what you did"""
"I drove to Alaska from Washington state a couple years ago in a tractor trailer. Those roads are already pretty ""interesting""."
"Lol, no."
Use it to your advantage. You will figure out a way. Just get your self esteem up real quick.
Is what I took from it lol.
Awesome - welcome aboard and tell your friends!
That‚Äôs reasonable
Honestly thought it was a peeled banana...
And that's all that matters. You found the right car at the right price. Congratulations!
My favorite joke of all time - whenever someone says 'My head hurts' you say 'it'll get better with practice'.
Of course you don't think it's relevant. Your empathy for human life is tentative at best.
Maybe you should get your cataracts removed to avoid walking into tree branches.
Can't wait for episode 5
Awesome! Glad you found it informative! Thanks for watching.
"Holy heck I'm so happy for you! That shit is an expense no one needs to worry about, and nor you don't! :D"

It's great that he was banned and your coworkers helped you out!! :D
Great Expectations!
"I was just thinking to myself ""maybe I should get Tinder"". Thank you for reassuring me that, nah I'm good without it."
If Wacky Races kept on going it would have 100% adult viewers
Yeah I can't imagine who wouldn't want to come out first to such a supportive friend
Love hearing [NAME] talk about money not gonna lie.

I‚Äôve been to two locations and the burgers are SO GOOD!!
"Boy, I literally didn't expect anyone to respond to this. Thanks, internet! I feel a tiny bit less alone."

"Don't worry, with a lifestyle that requires them to have a new hip before the age of 20 they won't be making it much further."
LOL [NAME] you're too loveable for that. ‚ô°
I couldnt help but laugh out loud. Pure stupidity coming from the mother. No other way to put it
school is not that bad
Great to hear something positive for once! Was half expecting a negative rant. Yay for [NAME] and congrats to you.
Man I just hope for a good ole fashion W
I always seem to date men with long hair and a beard. Often with blue eyes.
Thank you for the advice. It is really really appreciated. üôÇ
"Heard that too lol. And how [NAME] is fantastic on the ball, but the lack of assists puts him down as a player ."
I love the '1000 paw slap' at the end.
This is the best one yet.
Looking super dope!
"Fair to say I won't have to pay pipebomb 10ETH. Happy New year, all!"
Just found out. Thanks for the tip.
It's a close one. I'm going to agree with you because look what happens when [NAME] goes down.
That's exactly what I said and not arguing in bad faith at all. I applaud your intellectual honesty and hope your sexually repressed dystopia is swiftly enacted.
LOL at this question! If he follows the sub...just read the topics for opinions! I call BS!
That‚Äôs crazy. Depending of the state you‚Äôd effectively be obligated to work for that employer.
Amazing photo. It looks like a watercolour.
Oh my god is this even an possibility? He‚Äôs one of my favorite college coaches. That mans voice is legendary.
"Unless you're trying it with dollarstore shit, don't risk wasting the money. Just enjoy it."
"And do they all follow her main account? See, she has fans, they just all happen to be her. Lol"
Great podcast called Uncover on this. Highly recommend!!
"True love isn't something you find, it's something you build. "

Thank you new best friend.
"*Oblivious to double standards Haha lucky he didn't have, * must not be a Hypocrite"

Nothing matters. The world was burning when you came in to it and it will be burning when you leave it.
Please don't use it as toothpaste. It will destroy your teeth.
I am from central pennsylvania and moved to AZ. Phoenix definitely has the nicest expressways in the country.
[NAME] reaction gives me life. His reaction when they got punched last episode was amazing too.
[NAME] loves his Starbucks!
"I already love [NAME]. [NAME] gorgeous, but just didn't charm me as fast Ms [NAME]."
"Oh wow thank you all for your opinions, I was just curious and wanted to stare at cool skins :3"
I'm on my legal age and he's my second partner. I wil try to find more about it...
"You're allowed to me a little mean here, no one will tell lol"
Bless you for raising awareness.

Thanks! Edit: hold up a sec. Cowboys?

"Okay, thank you very much! So we are off the deep end of Riverdale logic here."
"Just typed out my comment and then I saw this. Yup, exactly."
That's ok I get it exactly you're ok with me
Maybe she‚Äôll think it was cute how shy you were
"As a high libido female, I feel the same with posts from males. It's slightly relieving to know someone else struggles the same way."
Yeah with this and the other thread DoorDash is definitely down. Just go home and don't answer any 650 numbers
"I'm the opposite. I love spending time with friends but initiating it always gives me anxiety, so I generally wait for them to do something."
Yeah I want all our players to have a nice healthy hatred for Texas. Good way to ensure they get hyped to play em.
"Hi, this is [NAME] from Hairspray the movie...I care! "
He's been pretty open about their very legal and very cool bromance
"""Family is forever""? Weird, I thought humans age and die relatively quickly."
She‚Äôs cool as hell
"Oh, cool. That‚Äôs the TF all the little kids like nowadays."
I actually found the whole screenshot ‚Äì without cropping ‚Äì on r/funny so I mean
"While it is unfortunate to hear that he is no longer interested, I hope that this brought some level of closure to you."
I love [NAME]
"That would be really great, but good luck."
I want the man who makes me pizza from scratch and then lovingly hand feeds it to me. Completely realistic expectation.
"I would say the answer is better education, not disenfranchisement based on socioeconomic circumstances, but you do you I guess."
CL...let‚Äôs just hope we can stay in EL for the time being.

Glad she's not living in a bubble then....
"I've always thought [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] are beautiful."
SOOOOO TRUE!!
There‚Äôs still hope!
"Gotcha, thanks for the reply. I know about the emulator ones, just wasn‚Äôt sure if any had been ported"
[NAME] loves you. Be yourself and don‚Äôt let bigots stop you.
That's true. People feel they can't trust anything so they just chose to believe what they want to believe.
I love how the sun just decides its going to pull Australia from Earth and cuddle with us... If only it didn't burn so much.
Thank you much better now
Because I don't like being fat lol.
I miss those lol
What a time to be alive.
Yes it was very hard but I appreciate it.
I love this. Just be racist against everyone and then it's fine!
[NAME] is retiring but I still agree with your point
[NAME] and [NAME] are definitely not wings. I like the other guys though.
Best pancakes in town!!
It's an... Interesting place. You seen that boy shoofta that posts on it? He ain't right.
I just want him to be successful though...I dont think he wants to be at this point
"Anytime, don't be afraid to reach out if you're feeling down. "
Glad to hear. It seems like a very hopeful sign. üëç
What‚Äôs the reference matter if it‚Äôs still insulting? Glad your degree is coming in handy for something.
Why do y'all gotta be mean like this. They're clearly comfortable with themselves
Any time he's passionate about something. I love seeing passionate people and 9/10 want to rip your clothes off.
Or you can just support your local farmers that slaughter their animals in an ethical and way less horrifying way.
"Ooh, the pupil proportion was wonderful at this time."
Looking good boah
My favorite kind of post
"Ha! Thanks - that's very flattering. For my part, FWIW, I always encourage folks to donate to their local farm sanctuary. ^**=o)**"
good luck. I'm hoping to get hrt this year and be a girl for my senior year.
Wonderfully said!
Start sending her a text when you go into the shower. Tell her you're starting your shower and you'll be ten minutes. See what happens.
Thank you so much! We will likely also be doing that haha :)
I wanna win this game so bad FJB
"I love this sub. Always 5% toxic, 95% thought out properly "
Random question but has your username ever actually worked lmao
"Have to admit, a completed quest log would've been nice."
Maybe focus on today instead of worrying about eternity? You'll get a lot more out of life that way.
Agreed. I'm happy he was able to find a resolution of sorts; to effectively overcome the event.
"Really like Molotov, such a great song!"
Thank you üôè
Wow so you've been around your entire country and spoken to every single person about traffic accidents? So cool.
Thank's for the notice.
Thank you. We literally had stopped her an hour before she made her break.
"[NAME], now i‚Äôm graduated trying to pay off my student loans"
Glad to hear it's ubiquitous and not an OS thing.
Put an echo or Alexa under it lol
You need to make sure that healthy food is within convenience for the players so that they don‚Äôt end up eating 2 minute noodles every day
"Thank you. I feel like I‚Äôve scarred her for life, but I know that‚Äôs probably not the case."
"It was a dig at OP not you ahah, this video was posted there over a year ago"
Cheers dude. Upvoted!
I would have said ok well I'll just take this back to the store.
Omg I love these things so much
I loved it so much more than I thought I would! [NAME] does an amazing job with quite a bizarre concept!
"It's a joke, fam."
That brilliant and so true!!!
"Cheers mate, ill do that!"
"Karma ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ What a great example for us all, sir. "
oh id love to hear it if you ever find it. he is one of my all time favorite authors
The only clown that make me laugh.
Totally. I'd be happy if they put the food directly into my hands.
"Another thank you, this is great info."
This blows. But I think [NAME] can do it alone if he gets a home health care assistant.
"Polls are closing now! If you're waiting to vote, stay in line! Results should be in shortly!"
She‚Äôs just overweight. I don‚Äôt see anything particularly wrong with her clothing. Lots of people dress adventurously.
"I would love to see spirit in her kimono as well if that,s possible in the future >< I love your work !"
"Don't worry looking for it, there isn't any porn tab/hidden message"
It's like you've never even been around dogs.
"Yes, it can be a very stressful read at times."
"I feel like I already knew, I just needed to have someone else tell me to really open up my eyes. Thank you for your comment"
Or just simply hinting at it. All in fun though
What a thoughtful and clever response. I've never seen anyone point out that someone posts in TD before. Very cool!
"Yeah, I do this too. It's almost comforting. I'm glad I'm not the only one."
Great documentary on that: Grandmas Boy.
Went to their other location in Capitol Reef National Park and it was fantastic. The cauliflower dough is great even if you're not into gluten-frei.
Everyone thinks that lol
Good news though. Yesterday the devs were running test server during the morning.
"Not OP, but this is a really great response and I'm saving it on my computer for a rainy day. Thank you."
But i really need you to delete the comment
Ahh yeah I've been there didn't know it had a name. Thanks dude.
This is so wildly specific I love it
i would love to have your neighbor!! he seems so nice! i really truly do hope you never meet that guy again.
I'll keep u updated man. It's only a 7eth withdrawal so hopefully it processes quickly.
Glad *you* find it funny!! You've ruined my morning!!
"You‚Äôre right, no one is taking you seriously, Reddit user."
"I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt expect that to be real"
That's the exact person who would buy one of those
Good for you OP! I hope you find a much better playgroup soon!
"Let it flow through you, become empowered by it. "
Women should have all the same rights as men. That does not include ending another human‚Äôs life.
Damn that is sexy
DJ finding consistency makes me happy
I was also [NAME]. We all make mistakes
"She has a disorder of sorts. Not only do you both need counseling, but she needs some kind of therapy. "
"Yep. This sub is just being overly reactionary, which surprises no one."
"I mean, I believe even Showgirls is a better movie than TLJ at this point."
Unfortunately not but I loved the saxy section and would love to see it again!
This inspiring.
It‚Äôs amazing.
"[NAME], back at it again with the awesome art."
"Hey there, I hope you're still with us. Let's talk."
yeah so even after this he got drafted at 41 only lol...and he dominated vs KAT and rest
A joke of a mock and I usually refrain from being critical of other people's perspectives of team needs and such.
"In doing so, they gave humanity a cinematic treasure for the ages. "
Seattle's train is nice... once you get there. It is an absolute hike from the terminal
the future is now old man
This guy is one of the best role models for [NAME]
(I tried to answer this in my below comment but I also just wanted to say I really love your username)
"I remember being so excited when we got AAA back, even though it cost us Fournier...man, that sure went south. #ThanksShaw"
Lol it's only been 7 years. Don't let your guard down now.
I love her attitude and confidence! She has such good sportsmanship
The website is still up. You want to see this. I've met the guy. He's super nice.
You must have a different definition of exciting. Ivan v Alyosha aka atheism vs [RELIGION] is very exciting.
I‚Äôm not attractive but thank you.
Lmao thanks for the update!
I love people that will go out of their way to save a small animal from traffic. Always help the cute ones! And they're all cute!!
I mean I love this but I actually think the backup was better.
I used to enjoy it and grew out of it.
Time to let the justice system run its course.
"I find that telling the truth as much as possible makes things less complicated. I've learned to spin the truth when needed, though."
I would love both of them
"That's cute. Sincerely Nepal, 7.6"
One of my favorite films. I got to see a screening with a live soundtrack conducted by [NAME]. There were tears in my eyes!
Thanks for the info! Safe scooting.
"Dont look back at the salt pillars, trust me."
That's awesome to hear. Now withdraw every dime from that website and never go back to it ever again.
"Wait, this is actually a really interesting point. That could/should play a factor if he‚Äòs a legitimate candidate. "
You mean your WolfDog Hybrids? Kidding.
I know plenty of old people who did just this
I read your story earlier today. Hun I'm here for you too. Pm me if you need.
AWESOME!!!! I'M GONNA TELL MY MOM HOW EPIC THIS IS AND MAYBE SHE'LL TAKE US TO CHUCK E CHEESE!!!
Thanks for adding water to an old nightmare
Hahaha this is gold
"Not gonna lie. Sucked out a few, but am really trying to analyze my play afterwards. Thanks!"
"Thank you, thank you. More people need to hear this."
I‚Äôm impressed.
"I dont disagree with taking the first steps, I just wish we would be even more ambitious. "
That‚Äôs nuts about the digging. I wish we had better dog boots that fit them more naturally than what we have.
It is crazy to me that there are even people in this sub that think [NAME] isn't worth his contract.
That sounds exactly like polos
I like this one she looks like she's basking in the warmth of the sun and just taking it all in it came out real nice partner
Thousands of people born every single day! But mine? Mine's a god damned miracle!
LOL watch this with the Raptors' commentary:
WOW THATS SO INTERESTING It happens to me so often that when I hear a new word I anticipate it but it all makes sense now

Praise the [NAME]
The game is pretty fun with items tho. Just obviously too random for esports

Sure. The subject of her video was certainly creepy and obnoxious.

I'm still rocking my Pebble 2SE.
I'm loving his new mask. Looking like a snack over there üòçü§§
It‚Äôs interesting that [NAME] is often the only little kid credited with being the one to desegregate schools in New Orleans.

Don't be angry. Encountering toxic people in online games is common and you won't change that. Try playing single-player or games with more sophisticated community

"Yeah, I agree. It left a bad taste in my mouth that they weren't even gonna mention it, so at least it's something."
I like it! I think the ideas of [NAME] can go a long way. I wish you the best of luck :)
Apologies for vertical view! Bonus commentary from my mini me that loves this sub!
Wishing the best for your pupper.
We don't deserve you. Thanks for the update. Happy it's being handled! :)
"Holy hell, that sub is nice."
"I hope so and I think they have the ability to, but I just have a bad feeling that they won't."
I want to see this happen simply because it makes no sense.
Its deathprofessor lol. That's her Twitter account.
This is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you so much!
"i love [NAME] and [NAME] so much, but... [NAME], my dudes."
"[NAME] after he declares he loves playing Fortnite, wants to play with his brother no matter what and loves Vancouver. "

"Female here - Personally, I would love a text that says ""I had a good time tonight! Would love to see you again."""

I give 90 percent odds that [NAME] will be reelected. And I think it will be at a much higher margin than 2016.
You‚Äôre funny if you think 27 vs 1 is going to somehow end in a good deal for the UK.

His friend was sexy as hell üíÅ
"I think we should, he is one of the best centers in the game "
I took in a friend of mine and creating a vanity for her (she loves to do her makeup) is honestly one of my more cherished memories.
"It is awesome, and nothing turns me on more (as far as giving pleasure to my lover goes). Seriously."
"Man, I would gladly roast this one. Fat rich people must be tasty.."
"I live in the South, lol, and this is really accurate."
At the same time liberals are lining up to applaud [NAME] for how incredibly woke they are...

I bet he‚Äôs not going to visit their hall of fame in order to avoid meeting w/ [NAME]
"See i was kinda right in the first verse, thanks aha"
Yo but that RivaL lineup tho! That's gonna be so sick
These things are so cool.

No one but they're mine and they protect me from facing the truth D:
You have sound advice. Thank you. Another issue I have is this is an entire state away from us. A minimum 4 hour drive.
i think you could say the chat about smelling their own farts was also added for comedic effect
[NAME] doesn't really look hindered by the way she's playing and hitting. I hope she doesn't retire. [NAME] just playing amazing.

I can‚Äôt see her cheeks...wait a min. Oh those cheeks!!
"Their wings are great! Huge, well breaded and sauced, comes with a nice dill ranch dipping sauce. But expensive as hell... $14 for 6 wings"
So basically the greatest person on earth.
Really Nice chiaroscuro
Im a revolver guy so I've always admired the rhino and its low bore axis design. The Rhino and the Kimber k6s are on my list.
We just got a ninja coffee machine. Don‚Äôt even need filters! It has little waste besides the coffee grounds. I love it.
I like [NAME] Colombian. Suspiciously cheap though.

I know I care about people more than animals... Im a fucking monster.
"No one is stopping you. I will laugh at you, but go ahead. "
This is even remotely funny
Your right. I just didn't want to go into depth out of laziness

"Gettysburg is awesome, I've been twice. I want to go back as an adult! Have fun!"
"Yeah I feel like we‚Äôd be able to do *something*, just not sure what... I find it interesting as hell though! "

And they lived happily ever after.
Thanks. Those are great suggestions.
Thank you for the new obsession.
Your inability to formulate an argument is what's most humorous. Oh great philosophers of free speech... Thanks for the laugh. Happy New Year!

Same. They responded really quickly like within an hour.

Thx! Happy New Year!
<3 [NAME]. You were too good for this world.
came here to say this. i've watched it through more than five times at this point. one of my absolute favorites.

I stopped watching after I had to suffer through a whole episode without [NAME] removing his shirt
People like you are why I follow this sub. Keep it up I need more laughs like that!

"edit: black gays and trans in the ball scene started it, much like a lot of our gay slang "
"This exact scene, as a matter of fact, haha."
"Thanks bud, hope it‚Äôs a great one!"
Lets just say its probably cheaper to just hope a more positive outlook reflects on your out-look.
Comedown is only a tenth of addiction. Addiction is when you find a high that you love more than yourself. Be careful.
Thanks I will try to delete the multiples. Good luck on everything.
[NAME] keeps getting set to get a rebound [NAME]
Thanks for the clarification :)

Oh man. You're the cutest.

"at least it rhymes,i'll give you that"
"It was SO refreshing to see. [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] were all so well coordinated. Hype"
I mean yeah that's really it. Getting him on tape saying racist stuff is the only possibility of a sale.
That's a great trailer. [NAME] needs more scars though.
Our ancestors took this land at great loss and developed into something greater than they were capable of being. Their descendants have the rightful claim to the land.

"Thanks for the link,much appreciated,great info you found."
I‚Äôd throw it back in for sure üëçüèº üé£
